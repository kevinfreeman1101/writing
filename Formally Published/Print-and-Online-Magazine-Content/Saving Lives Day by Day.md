# Saving Lives Day by Day

Kevin Freeman

When you’re driving every day, it’s easy to fall into corner-cutting habits with daily inspections to save some precious time. We all get tired or fall behind schedule; it happens every day. In some cases, drivers ignore safety concerns because they can’t afford the down time for repairs, or they don’t have enough money, or they’re worried about losing their jobs if they refuse to drive a company truck that doesn’t make par. 

For these reasons and more, about a quarter of the trucks inspected at checkpoints and weigh stations are found to have serious enough safety violations to get shut down - and many more are slipping past undetected, according to state and federal inspectors. 

If you’ve been driving for very long, you’ve hard the stories that populate truck stop lounges and evening news reports everywhere. Post-accident inspections find malfunctioning brakes, steer-tires worn down to the belts, and safety systems that were simply not maintained. 

The truth is that every time a driver gets behind the wheel of a truck that isn’t fully inspected and properly maintained, the lives of everyone on the road around that truck are at risk, and scarcely a day goes by in the United States when someone doesn’t lose their lives for it. 

I witnessed one such accident on a clear summer day that I’ll never forget, driving southbound on I-25, just outside of Colorado Springs, toward the end of a particularly grueling shift. About a half-mile in front of me, a drilling rig truck blew a steer-tire at 70 miles per hour, causing the truck to roll onto it’s top and off the highway. More than a few people, myself included, pulled over to help, but by the time we broke into the mangled cab, it was already too late. The worst thing about the incident was that, had the driver properly inspected his truck, and chosen to change the badly worn tire, he would probably still be driving today. 

It goes without saying that my pre-and-post trip inspections saw significant improvement after that unforgettable day. 

While a steer-tire should seem like an obvious thing to check and maintain, there are many other parts on a truck that could cause a similar incident, and only a thorough inspection will catch the lurking danger - anything from a broken leaf spring to lug nuts that took a few weeks to vibrate loose after a tire change, to a badly pitted windshield turning into the sun. At highway speeds, it’s too late to do something about it, making a minor issue become a lifelong regret, or worse. 

But there's good news in this story as well. 

Witnessing that horrible event caused me to start doing what I could to make a difference. It’s not too late to renew our determination to make 2012 the safest year to date on America’s highways and city streets. For a driver, saving lives starts with a healthy pre-trip and ends by safely parking our rigs at the end of a long day and forcing ourselves to do a post-trip inspection even though we’d much rather take a long deserved rest. 

What do you do every day to keep our highways safe?

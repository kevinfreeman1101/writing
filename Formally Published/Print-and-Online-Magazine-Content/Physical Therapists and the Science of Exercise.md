# Physical Therapists and the Science of Exercise

By Kevin Freeman

It’s easy to think of physical therapy as an effective treatment for strengthening muscles after bone breaks, sprains, and related physical injuries, but these conditions only scratch the surface of ways that it can improve patient’s lives. Thanks to numerous clinical studies, modern physical therapy techniques are now rendering lasting benefits to patients in new areas like cancer treatment and psychological illnesses, adding effective tools to craft even more beneficial treatment plans. 

## In Conjunction with Cancer Treatment

The Seattle Cancer Care Alliance currently employs physical therapy to give cancer patients a significantly higher quality of life in many integral ways. 

Some of the conditions for which physical therapy is commonly prescribed include: 

- Leukemia/Lymphoma

- Multiple Myeloma

- Bone Marrow Transplant Patients

- Chronic Graft-Versus-Host disease

- Breast Cancer

- Melanoma

- Head and Neck Cancer

- Prostate Cancer

- Lung Cancer

- Sarcoma

To brighten the lives of cancer patients, physical therapists use the utmost caution, closely monitoring patient conditions to ensure that the proper level of activity is maintained, but not exceeded, during each phase of treatment. Physical therapists are extensively trained to ensure that their patients receive the greatest result with the least amount of risk – an important consideration for those who prefer to self-administer their physical therapy plans.

The benefits of using physical therapy for cancer patients are many, including:

- Pain, safety, and fatigue management

- Spinal bracing to assist proper healing and pain relief

- Limb desensitization after amputation

- Maximizing lung function before and after cancer treatment

- Overall shoulder stretching and strengthening

- Lymphedema risk-reduction education

- Baseline arm or leg girth measurements

- Assessment for axillary web syndrome (cording)

- Manual lymph drainage/self-manual lymph drainage massage

- Scar-tissue work

Physical therapy programs for these conditions should only be obtained at the hands of a licensed physical therapist, but you may be surprised at the many ways that a well planned physical therapy program can improve a patient’s quality of life. 

## Improving Mental Health

On the psychological front, physical therapy still has a bit farther to go, as only about 10% of mental health professionals have fully embraced the synergistic relationship between the human mind and body. Despite this common lack, there is ample evidence stemming from numerous clinical studies, that strongly links physical therapy to sustained improvement in many psychological illnesses. 

In the 1991 Pelham and Campagna study, schizophrenic patients were monitored before and after engaging in 30 minutes of cycling per day, 4 days per week. The result showed decreased depression, coupled with an increased general sense of well being in their patients. 

Another study by Faulkner and Sparkes in 1999 documented schizophrenic patients exercising twice per week for 10 weeks. The result showed a reduction in auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), increased self-esteem, and improved overall sleep patterns. 

After these studies were conducted, many subsequent studies documented similar results for various psychological conditions – even going on to show that the most severe cases of depression got even better results from physical therapy than the milder cases. Physical therapy was, by no means, offered in any of these cases as a substitute for medication, but in many instances, medication amounts were lowered, and some patients were able to reduce the number of medications taken.

## Physical Pain Reduction

If you’ve ever been seriously injured, you know  how difficult it can be to properly manage your pain. Most pain relieving prescriptions only lessen the symptoms, and most effective pain medicines can only be taken if you don’t need to drive, operate heavy machinery, or use your brain on more than a basic level during the day. This leaves few options to those who wish to reduce or eliminate pain while functioning to their fullest each day. 

But there may still be hope.

A study by the American Physical Therapy Association indicates that patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders like back and neck pain showed marked improvement – or even elimination – of their symptoms as a result of physical therapy and education. By strengthening the muscles around the spine, mobilizing the spine, and studying the common sources of pain, some patients are able to avoid pain drugs completely, and can even find complete relief from otherwise debilitating chronic pain. 

Always consult with a doctor before engaging in alternative therapies, and stick to the plans outlined therein. But be sure to ask about the significant results that a licensed physical therapist has to offer.

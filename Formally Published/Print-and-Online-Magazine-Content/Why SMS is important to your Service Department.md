# Why SMS is Important to Your Service Department

Kevin Freeman

As the most widely used data application in the world, SMS data messaging has become well known for revolutionizing business practices and increasing profitability by maximizing customer exposure and operational efficiency. While automotive sales departments have greatly benefited from SMS marketing strategies, the potent ability of SMS to improve service department profitability should not be overlooked. 

Through automated appointment confirmations, customer arrival notifications, and job progress announcements, SMS messaging enables service departments to run smoother and faster by allowing technicians to focus on their work while their customers are free to go anywhere and stay connected. The same automated services can also raise consumer attraction and retention levels through SMS-based customer loyalty plans, coupon programs, special drawings and contests, or by conveniently reminding customers of regular maintenance items.

If transitioning to a new SMS system seems a bit daunting, companies such as SMS Media Group are ready to alleviate any hesitations; many services are offered free of charge to assist with setting up and maintaining the system, plus free training and support are standard features. 

The usefulness of SMS has quickly set the new benchmark of convenience, efficiency, and profitability for automotive businesses, convincing many to make it an integral part of their operations.

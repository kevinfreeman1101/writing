# Proposed Government Mandate Requires 20% Lower Fuel Consumption for Truckers 

By Kevin Freeman

After the Obama administration released a Presidential Memorandum last May, the US government began planning, and has now proposed legislation that will require semi-truck drivers to get 20 percent better fuel mileage by 2018. Despite the potential economic crunch that this will place on the transportation industry – in addition to every subsequent industry who gets their supplies through heavy trucks – some interesting ideas are coming down the line as to how this might be accomplished.

On September 19, 2011, the average price of diesel fuel was $3.83 per gallon. If a truck driver averages 140,000 miles each year, getting 7.5 miles per gallon, this equates to a fuel cost of $71,493 per year at current average costs. Compare this to a fuel cost of $59,577 if fuel mileage was increased by 20% - a savings of $11,916 per year is achieved if the same miles are driven. 

One way truckers are already saving up to 27 percent in fuel and maintenance costs is through limiting their average speeds to around 60 mph. While this can result in traveling fewer miles each year, the reduction of fuel and maintenance costs also results in the same drivers making an additional 4.5 cents per mile when compared with hauling the same freight at 70 mph, according to one study. This is a very important benefit for owner operators and company drivers who buy their own fuel.  

“As a rule of thumb, for every one mile per hour increase in speed, there is a corresponding 0.14 mpg penalty in fuel consumption,” said Glen Kedzie, VP of Environmental Affairs for the American Trucking Associations, in an interview with National Geographic Magazine. Glen goes on to say that drivers should stay in the “sweet spot” of 60-65 mph for the best results. 

However, reducing speed isn’t the only option being considered. 

Thanks to advances in driver monitoring technology, companies are not only able to see where their drivers are at any given time, ensuring that regulations are followed, but they can also track how those drivers are handling their rigs under various conditions. By measuring fuel burning practices like hard braking or unnecessary revving, and offering automated real-time coaching as drivers exhibit dangerous or inefficient behaviors, the on-board systems offered by companies like GreenRoad or Shell Oil and Gas advertise an ability to reduce fuel consumption by an additional 10 percent – amounting to another $5,957 in savings from the example used above. 

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), most semi-truck drivers would have their investment returned in less than one year if they spend the money needed to implement commercially available technologies that increase their fuel performance and reduce maintenance costs. Additionally, the same technologies would save drivers up to $74,000 over the course of the truck’s operational life. 

If these systems, combined with reduced driving speeds, all add up to the savings advertised, that could mean up to $17,873 annually staying in driver’s pockets. 

Additional recommendations for fuel savings include choosing a rig that is designed for optimal aerodynamics, installing a remote-start climate control system that starts the engine and idles only until the ideal cab temperature is reached before shutting back down, keeping the distance between the tractor and trailer at a minimum to reduce wind drag, and regularly checking tire pressure on all 18 wheels.

Regardless of the often frustrating requirements that the government continually attempts to place on the transportation industry, fuel and maintenance savings can significantly increase the amount of money that drivers get to place in their pockets at the end of the day. Whether these requirements pass or fail, owner operators and trucking fleet managers might do well to check into these available resources to not only reduce costs, but also keep drivers up to 50% safer as they travel.

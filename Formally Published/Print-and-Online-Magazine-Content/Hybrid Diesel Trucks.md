# Hybrid Diesel Trucks Boast 30% Fuel Savings

As modern operating costs continue to rise in the midst of an economic nightmare, the farthest thing from most drivers’ minds is the added expense of purchasing a new vehicle. An alarming number of veteran drivers, in fact, are actually turning in their titles as profits dry up, and the not-so-distant future seems to promise only more of the same. However, the PACCAR-Eaton heavy-truck hybrid system, to begin production in late 2009 on selected Kenworth and Peterbuilt trucks, may cause at least a few brokenhearted drivers to change their minds and stay in the game. 

The PACCAR-Eaton hybrid system, designed specifically for use in heavy duty diesel trucks, places an electricity generating motor onto the output of an automated clutch and connects it with the input of a Fuller UltraShift transmission. One significant feature of the electric motor is to recover much of the energy that would otherwise be lost through braking, using the added energy to charge an extensive battery set that works synergistically with the diesel motor, either helping the truck to run at optimal levels, or completely taking over the workload for the ultimate in fuel economy. 

Not only does this system offer significant fuel savings on the road, but the extra battery storage also allows drivers to sit for longer periods of time without needing to burn fuel for air conditioning and power. In states like California, where new laws have banned idling trucks no matter how hot or dangerous conditions become, hybrid systems like these are already being clamored over as the salvation from a stifling web of political red tape. After all, what could be better than enjoying all of the amenities that modern trucks come equipped with – and their drivers deserve to be able to use – without breaking those cumbersome laws written by politicians who have probably never been closer to the inside of a truck than the backseats of their passing limousines.

In addition to the revolutionary hybrid concept, PACCAR recently rolled out the Kenworth CleanPower and Peterbuilt Comfort Class climate control systems, which offer up to 10 hours of climate control, plus 120 volt “hotel load” power without requiring a single drop of precious diesel fuel. By integrating this system into the next generation of Kenworth and Peterbuilt trucks, modern drivers suddenly have a very bright light beckoning the approach of some much needed relief. 

Technological solutions such as these present fantastic short term solutions for an alarming energy crisis, but they also bring about the hope that our long term energy shortages will be reduced or eliminated as well. Imagine America’s entire fleet of heavy duty trucks suddenly gaining 30% in fuel efficiency levels. Imagine the effect this drop in usage would most certainly have in quickly lowering painful fuel prices. Perhaps this explains the EPA’s 2007 exclaim over PACCAR’s strong drive to bring improvement to the freight hauling industries, giving Kenworth T2000 and T660 and Peterbuilt 387 and 386 models the coveted SmartWay designation.

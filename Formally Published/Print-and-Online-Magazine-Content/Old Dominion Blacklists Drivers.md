# Old Dominion Blacklists Drivers who Self-Report Alcohol Problems: Now Sued by EEOC

By Kevin Freeman

Charles Grams had been driving for Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. for five years without incident when he decided to seek help with an alcohol problem. Choosing to do what he thought was the right thing, he reported his problem to Old Dominion, who immediately suspended his driving privileges in accordance with federal regulations. Then they told him that he would never drive for their organization again – even after successfully completing an alcohol counseling program. 

In fact, Old Dominion wouldn’t allow Grams to continue working for them at all until the alcohol counseling program was completed, and then, even if he met this requirement, they would force a demotion on him, relegating him to part-time dock work at barely more than half of his previous hourly wage and with all of his benefits revoked. 

Upon hearing of Charles Grams’ situation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission decided to act, filing litigation against Old Dominion on behalf of Grams and at least one other similarly affected driver. 

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act (ADAAA) of 2008, alcoholism meets the definition of a genuine disability, and those who suffer from it should be treated no differently than any other disabled person. Federal discrimination laws prohibit any company from firing an employee because he or she struggles with alcoholism, although employers should still revoke driving privileges – at least temporarily – for safety reasons, and to maintain compliance with federal regulations regarding the use of alcohol on the job. 

Was Old Dominion trying to do the right thing with their action against Grams, or is it possible that they were too harsh on the self-reporting driver? Should they have made his part time dock-working job conditional on completing his alcohol counseling? Or would a more fair option have been to revoke his driving privileges and allow him to seek the treatment he needed with no further consequences and continued full time benefits and employment? The courts will soon decide. 

According to statistics released by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in 2010, 52% of American adults are regular drinkers. Likewise, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, more than 41% of those admitted to a publicly funded substance abuse program in 2008 were there at least in part because of alcohol addiction. In addition to these figures, 3 of every 10 American drivers will, at some point in their lives, be involved in an alcohol related accident.

The problems are prevalent and clear, but the solutions to these problems are still items of heavy debate in the minds of American lawmakers and companies.

There is no doubt that trucking companies must walk a fine line between keeping their own drivers and reputations safe – along with making public safety and compliance with federal regulations a top priority – and going too far in enforcing substance abuse policies. But policies that hand out permanently harsh consequences to self reporting drivers like Charles Grams may be causing many more like him to keep their mouths shut if they have a problem, and that’s exactly what the EEOC wants to prevent. 

Joe McCarty, legal counsel for Old Dominion, refused to comment on the situation before the litigation plays out, but he did say that Old Dominion will back its decisions regarding Charles Grams. 

Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. is based in Thomasville, North Carolina, with 211 offices nationally. Charles Grams’ case emerged from Old Dominion’s Fort Smith, Arkansas office.

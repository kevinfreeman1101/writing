# Staying Flush with Holiday Cash: Maximize Your Possibilities

Kevin Freeman

If you’re looking to pick up some extra cash for the holiday season, then you certainly aren’t alone in the driving industry. There are approximately 3.5 million truck drivers in the US, and in the month of December, the vast majority are trying to secure every load they can find to buy gifts, keep the bills paid, and do everything they can to make it home by Christmas. Then comes January, when purchases made with credit cards start getting paid off – resulting in an even tighter market for keeping the wheels turning. 

In true holiday spirit (and throughout the year), the staff here at Careers in Gear would like to do their part. If you’re looking for a load and you haven’t yet taken a look at our [Freight Finder](http://www.careersingear.com/freight-finder), let me be the first to invite you to try it on for size. We’ve got hundreds of loads posted, already sorted by state and location, and each posting includes the contact information you need to secure your load and keep the holiday dollars flowing. 

Why wait on a dispatcher or freight broker, who may be tied up with other loads, or might not understand the financial consequences of your dead time. Be proactive and make sure that your rig stays moving until you’re ready to take a well deserved vacation. 

Another way to increase your bottom line is to make sure you’re earning top dollar for every mile you drive. Between finding job listings, making phone calls, sending in applications, scheduling interviews... the list goes on Trying to switch jobs is one of the most difficult tasks to undertake while you’re out on the road (check out [Switching Trucking Employers](http://news.careersingear.com/trucking-industry-news/switching-trucking-employers/) for more on this). 

Instead of putting up with all of that hassle, try the Careers in Gear solution and [Apply Online](http://driver.careersingear.com/driver/application) for driving jobs by filling out one simple form. The form doesn’t take long to complete, and you can even add yourself to our email list, just to ensure that you maintain awareness of every available opportunity and continue making top dollar for your efforts, no matter what. It’s that easy!  

Still feel like you could be making more than an average freight driver? That may be because you know that driving a bigger truck, driving hazmat loads, or hauling doubles and triples usually pays more per load than hauling standard freight. In addition to the potential extra pay, adding these endorsements to your CDL can also keep you busier throughout the year, since you’ll have access to loads that the average driver isn’t qualified for. 

If you want to add more endorsements to your CDL, upgrade your license class, or even if you don’t yet have a CDL and want to get one, but you also want to stick with a reputable driving school, then check out our [Schools ](http://www.careersingear.com/education)link to see which establishments the staff at Careers in Gear has checked out. Shop around for the schools nearest you to make your driving time as profitable as it can possibly be.

No matter where you go, there are always those who like to complain about their lack of opportunities while staying broke; on the other hand, there are also those who choose to be proactive about maximizing their opportunities no matter where they find themselves in life. Can you guess which of these approaches leads to far greater income over the course of a career?

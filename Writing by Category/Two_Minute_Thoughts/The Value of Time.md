# The Value of Time

Time is valuable. I say this often, but I don't always value time as I should. If I am proactive in life, my goal should be to maximize my ability to live up to my name; Freeman.

How many hours of the day do I work for myself versus hours spent doing things for other people? It's a good idea to keep this equation in healthy balance, not leaning too far in either direction. This doesn't mean I will always have to work for other people; only that my interactions with other people should be fun while also generating sufficient income for basic survival with resources left over for fun activities.

In other words, business interaction is nearly as healthy as free and open exchange of thoughts and ideas with a wide variety of other people, provided that the interactions are constructive. Personal time is equally critical, as this allows time for ideological rumination and digestion.

Humans gain much through healthy interaction with each other; exchanging ideas with other people maximizes our ability to be creative. Many ideas may be amalgamated in good conversationalists, but we also realize creative gains by: learning professional trades; challenging ourselves in new and interesting ways; studying philosophy; etc.

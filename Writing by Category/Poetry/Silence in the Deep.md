# Silence in the Deep

**by Kevin L. Freeman**

_________________________

Silence in the deep,

drifting through the void,

I float across the nothing,

I cannot be destroyed.

Drifting through the darkness,

I fear the fade to black,

a fire wells inside me,

it lights the one way back.

By what means have I come here?

To where must I return?

I feel the pull and lose control,

my spirit, oh it burns.

The voices call across the void,

they say it’s nice inside.

They say the grass is green,

and it’s as deep as it is wide.

They tell me nothing’s better,

as good as things can be.

I hear the lie and know their cry,

yet silence meets their glee.

Blackness all around me,

my sparks begin to fade,

I slip on down the spiral,

my fate, it seems, is made.

As sleep removes all thoughts and sounds,

the sparks have all but gone.

Who am I and what is this,

that has all come to none?

Fleeting thoughts unbound by mind,

it seems I’m free at last.

All becomes so clear to me,

my heart recoils, aghast.

I know not which is up or down,

but down I must not go.

A voice calls through the shadows,

someone that I should know.

My Father used to tell me,

to keep away from this.

I told him I could own it all,

I knew I would find bliss.

He cried the day I left Him there,

a voice that pierced the black.

He told me he would find a way,

to bring my spirit back.

I sense my flesh is fading,

the stench of filth and rot.

I’ve brought it all upon myself,

I’ve left without a thought.

In bitterness I weep,

though sadness seems a dream.

The flesh, the pain, it finally dies,

my whimpers kill the screams.

Yet still I taste upon my lips,

a flow so bittersweet.

I feel the hand that grasps my soul,

scrape death from blackened feet.

What tormentor has seized me now?

Why can I not rest here?

My tired eyes are crusted shut,

I feel his presence near.

His tears of blood now drip,

upon my face, my heart, my soul.

A spark alights within me,

my spirit still is whole.

His voice so loud it pains me,

His face so bright and near.

I see the path before me,

the blood is oh so clear.

But why is my Lord bleeding?

Such sadness in his eyes!

“The burden is so great”, he screams,

“it kills your precious lies.

My Father has forsaken me,

that you may home return.

Just take the path I’ve left for you,

My son you must not turn.”

But Lord you must not leave me here,

I scream into the night.

My lips move but nothing sounds,

save wind to death’s delight.

My Lord has gone- he’s left me here,

yet I begin to move.

My eyes can see, 

my heart can feel,

as blood and love does prove.

I hear His screams; they fill my head,

and up His path I run.

I’m sorry Lord I’ve failed you,

I’ve killed your only son.

My shame is great; it holds me back,

but fear drives me along.

For days and nights I drink this blood,

and blood brings me back home.

My Father stands and greets me now,

the flesh he makes like new.

I cannot look upon him,

my sorrow, shame so true.

But at his table now I sit,

and nothing hides my shame.

I cannot bear to live here,

while Christ takes all my blame.

And when I feel his gentle hand,

it strokes my hair so sweet.

I lift my head enough to see the holes within his feet.

“We’re home my son”, he whispers.

My eyes are open wide.

My Lord is here and now we laugh, 

for all has been made right.

I can’t believe the joy I know,

Beyond the grave of sins,

One thing I know more than all else,

I’ll never leave again.

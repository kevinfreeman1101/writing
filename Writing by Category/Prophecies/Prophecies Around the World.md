Ancient texts and mythologies from various cultures have predicted the end of the world by fire in several notable instances:

Norse Mythology - Ragnarok: In Norse mythology, Ragnarok is a series of apocalyptic events culminating in a great battle where giants of frost and fire fight the gods. This battle leads to the destruction of the world, which is then submerged under water. However, the world is expected to resurface anew, with surviving gods meeting again (Source 1, 12).

Christian Eschatology - The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: In Christian eschatology, particularly in the Book of Revelation, the end times are marked by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. These horsemen bring conquest, war, famine, and death, leading to a final judgment and the cleansing of the Earth, often interpreted as involving fire (Source 10, 17).

Zoroastrianism - Zoroastrian texts predict a final renovation of the world called Frashokereti. This involves a purifying fire that will melt the metal in the mountains, which will then flow across the earth to purify it and all souls (Source 11).

Hinduism - The End of Kali Yuga: Hindu eschatology describes the end of the current age, Kali Yuga, as a time of great destruction. The god Kalki is prophesied to appear, bringing an end to the age with a fiery apocalypse, after which a new cycle of creation begins (General Knowledge).

Ancient Mesopotamian Texts - Some ancient Mesopotamian texts, such as those from the Sumerians, contain prophecies of the end times involving fire and destruction, although these are less specific and more symbolic in nature (Source 0).

Greek Mythology: Phaethon: The myth of Phaethon, who loses control  of the sun chariot, causing it to veer too close to the Earth and set it  on fire, is one example of a fiery end in Greek mythology  (MythologyWorldwide).

Hinduism: Kalki Avatar: Hindu eschatology includes the belief  that the world will end in fire during the final phase of the Kali  Yuga, the last of the four stages the world goes through as part of the  cycle of yugas. Kalki, the final avatar of Vishnu, is prophesied to  appear and bring an end to the current age, often depicted with fiery  destruction (general knowledge).

Ancient Egyptian Mythology: Destruction by Fire: Some interpretations of  Egyptian mythology suggest that the world could end in a great  conflagration, although this is less explicit compared to other  traditions (general knowledge).

These predictions reflect a common theme across cultures where fire symbolizes both destruction and purification, often leading to a renewal or rebirth of the world.

### Python Langchain Tutorial

===========================

#### Introduction

-----------------

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Python functions to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) and provide context for user interaction 
sessions using the [LangChain](https://github.com/kingofmorocca/langchain) library.

#### Step 1: Install LangChain

--------------------------------

To get started, install LangChain using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain
```

#### Step 2: Import LangChain and Define a Python Function

---------------------------------------------------------

Next, import LangChain and define a Python function that will interact with the LLM to provide context for user interaction sessions. For this example, let's create a function called `get_context`:

```python
import langchain

def get_context(prompt):
    # Use LangChain to generate context from the prompt
    context = langchain.generate_text(prompt, model="EleutherAI/insurance-LLaMA-400M")
    return context
```

In this example, we're using the `generate_text` function from LangChain to generate text based on a given prompt. The `model` parameter specifies which
LLM to use for generation.

#### Step 3: Test the Function with Some Sample Data

---------------------------------------------------

Let's test our `get_context` function with some sample data:

```python
prompt = "What is the best way to improve customer satisfaction?"
context = get_context(prompt)
print(context)
```

This should output some generated text based on the prompt. You can adjust the prompt and model parameters to see how they affect the output.

#### Step 4: Integrate LangChain with Your Python Application

-------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have a working `get_context` function, let's integrate it with our Python application. For this example, let's create a simple chatbot that 
responds to user input:

```python
import langchain

class Chatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context = ""

    def respond(self, prompt):
        context = get_context(prompt)
        self.context += context + "\n"
        return context

chatbot = Chatbot()

while True:
    user_input = input("User: ")
    response = chatbot.respond(user_input)
    print(f"Chatbot: {response}")
```

In this example, we're creating a simple chatbot that responds to user input by calling our `get_context` function with the user's prompt. The context 
is then printed out.

#### Conclusion

----------------

That's it! We've successfully used Python functions to interact with LLMs and provide context for user interaction sessions using LangChain. You can customize this example to fit your specific use case, such as creating a more advanced chatbot or integrating LangChain with other natural language processing (NLP) libraries.

I hope this tutorial has been helpful in getting you started with LangChain and Python. Happy coding!

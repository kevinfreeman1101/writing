### Hosting a Production Django Application with Remote Postgresql 16 Database

=====================================================================

#### Secure Postgresql Configuration and Setup

---------------------------------------------------

To ensure the security of your remote PostgreSQL database, follow these steps:

* **Create a new user**: `CREATE ROLE myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';`
* **Grant privileges**: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO myuser;`
* **Set password**: `ALTER ROLE myuser SET PASSWORD 'mypassword';`
* **Create a new database**: `CREATE DATABASE mydatabase OWNER myuser;`
* **Secure the database**: `ALTER DATABASE mydatabase SET ENCODING 'UTF-8';`

#### Integration of Reliable User Login System

---------------------------------------------------

To integrate a reliable user login system, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary packages: `pip install django-allauth`
2. Add the following code to your settings.py file:

```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'allauth.social_accountbackend.AllAuthBackend'
]

```

1. Configure the allauth package by adding the following code to your settings.py file:

```python
SOCIAL_AUTH_PIPELINE = [
    'allauth.social_accountpipeline.EmailSocialPipeline'
]
```

1. Create a new view for user login: `views.py`
2. Update your urls.py file with the new view:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import login_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', login_view, name='login'),
]
```

#### User Account Functions

---------------------------------------------------

To allow users to securely upload documents for storage in private databases, follow these steps:

1. Create a new model for the uploaded documents: `models.py`
2. Define the fields for the document model:

```python
class Document(models.Model):
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='documents')
```

3. Create a new view to handle the document upload: `views.py`
4. Update your urls.py file with the new view:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import document_upload_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('documents/', document_upload_view, name='document_upload'),
]
```

#### Advanced Data Security Practices and Data Isolation Protocols

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure advanced data security practices and data isolation protocols, follow these steps:

1. Use a secure password manager to generate and store passwords.
2. Implement two-factor authentication for user accounts.
3. Use HTTPS encryption for all database connections.
4. Implement row-level locking for concurrent updates.
5. Use a separate database for sensitive data.

#### Membership Tracking and Payment System Integration

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To integrate membership tracking and payment system, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary packages: `pip install stripe`
2. Create a new model for the memberships: `models.py`
3. Define the fields for the membership model:

```python
class Membership(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    plan = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    start_date = models.DateField()
```

4. Create a new view to handle the membership payment: `views.py`
5. Update your urls.py file with the new view:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import membership_payment_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('memberships/', membership_payment_view, name='membership_payment'),
]
```

#### Shopping App with Cart and Payment System

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To integrate a shopping app with cart and payment system, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary packages: `pip install django-cartoons`
2. Create a new model for the products: `models.py`
3. Define the fields for the product model:

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
```

4. Create a new view to handle the shopping cart: `views.py`
5. Update your urls.py file with the new view:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import shopping_cart_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('cart/', shopping_cart_view, name='shopping_cart'),
]
```

#### Membership Setup Screen

---------------------------------------------------

To integrate a membership setup screen for users to set up accounts, upgrade, or cancel their memberships, follow these steps:

1. Create a new model for the memberships: `models.py`
2. Define the fields for the membership model:

```python
class Membership(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    plan = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    start_date = models.DateField()

```
3. Create a new view to handle the membership setup: `views.py`
4. Update your urls.py file with the new view:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import membership_setup_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('memberships/', membership_setup_view, name='membership_setup'),
]

```

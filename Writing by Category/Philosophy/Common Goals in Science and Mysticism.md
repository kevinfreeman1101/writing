# Common Goals in Science and Mysticism

[Original Post](https://x.com/FreemanWriting/status/1808540742341501191)

Science and mysticism both pursue the same goal of ultimate and absolute truth. Atheistic scientists study this from a purely physical perspective while mystics (some of whom are accredited scientists) employ higher dimensional methods.

Both groups experiment and learn, documenting their findings and advancing their capabilities. Mystics call this source the All in all and God, but atheists who have taken the time to consider what exists outside of spacetime call it the singularity.  

In many ways, the two groups are not so different from each other, but physical purists seem always to recoil from the idea that all must be connected through the singularity which is the prime cause of both consciousness and the universe (if there be any difference between the two).

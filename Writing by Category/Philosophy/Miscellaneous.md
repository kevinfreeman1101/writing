## Common Goals in Science and Mysticism

[Original Post](https://x.com/FreemanWriting/status/1808540742341501191)

Science and mysticism both pursue the same goal of ultimate and absolute truth. Atheistic scientists study this from a purely physical perspective while mystics (some of whom are accredited scientists) employ higher dimensional methods.

Both groups experiment and learn, documenting their findings and advancing their capabilities. Mystics call this source the All in all and God, but atheists who have taken the time to consider what exists outside of spacetime call it the singularity.  

In many ways, the two groups are not so different from each other, but physical purists seem always to recoil from the idea that all must be connected through the singularity which is the prime cause of both consciousness and the universe (if there be any difference between the two).

Science - the systematic study of how everything works

Philosophy - the systematic study of how everything works

Religion - the systematic study of how everything works

We're all pursuing the same goal using very different methods. Reconcile all 3 for true enlightenment.

"Among the ancients, science, philosophy, and religion were never considered as separate units. Each was regarded as an integral part of the whole. The unfolding of man's nature is as much an exact science as astronomy, medicine, or jurisprudence."
~Manly P. Hall

## Populating the Universe

Even if only a single photon exists outside of spacetime, it could populate the entire universe simply by inserting itself into the initially-void medium of spacetime over and over again, living through an infinite number of universal photon lives.

This would be a lonely journey for the first few quintillion cycles, but eventually that single photon could generate enough interaction to condense into the full extent of physical matter currently surrounding us. 

There is no limit to this creative potential and, since photons do not experience the passage of time, it would seem to take no time at all to manifest anything desired at any scale.

With that being said, we know that God is much more than a single photon because each one of us- mind, consciousness, and all- originates from the same source.

## The Composition of Reality

In a realm beyond the confines of space and time, where every molecule of existence is intertwined as one, the ultimate reality—often referred to as God or the Divine—embodies the universe as its own manifestation. This boundless consciousness creates the fabric of spacetime by shaping its essence into the dimensions we know. In this primordial state, all that exists is an undivided unity, where every event and outcome has already unfolded.

This concept echoes the ancient Vedic texts, particularly the Upanishads, which describe Brahman as the ultimate, unchanging reality amidst and beyond the world, which cannot be exactly defined. The Mundaka Upanishad states, "Brahman is infinite, and the universe is infinite. The infinite proceeds from the infinite. Then taking the infinitude of the infinite, it remains as the infinite Brahman alone."

Every individual life born into our physical universe is a unique expression of this original unity, akin to a spark or a fragment of the divine essence that radiates from the All. This spark, imbued with the potential for self-awareness, enters the physical realm without any conscious memory of its origins or the completeness of the All. As it takes on individuality, the spark becomes aware of its own existence and begins to navigate the complexities of spacetime.

This process of individuation, where the unity manifests as distinct life forms, is a fundamental aspect of our reality. The illusion of separation and individuality is necessary for the experience of growth, learning, and the unfolding of potential within the constraints of time and space. As we explore this vast tapestry of existence, we can begin to appreciate the intricate web of relationships that binds us all together.

In essence, every life in our universe is a reflection of the divine unity, carrying within it the potential for spiritual awakening and reconnection with the All. This understanding invites us to consider the profound implications of our existence: that each individual's story is intertwined with the grand narrative of the universe, and that every action, thought, or intention has consequences that ripple across spacetime.

The Bhagavad Gita, another ancient text, speaks to this interconnectedness and the divine play of creation. In Chapter 10, Verse 20, Krishna says, "I am the Self, O Gudakesha, seated in the hearts of all creatures. I am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all beings."

In this transcendent state, there is no distinction between past, present, and future; all events are eternally present in the divine consciousness. However, when these sparks of life enter the physical universe, they are enveloped in the illusion of separation and individuality. This amnesia allows for the development of a unique identity and the exploration of free will. Through the journey of life, each individual soul seeks to rediscover its connection to the divine unity from which it originated. The process of living, learning, and evolving in the physical world is thus a sacred journey back to the source, where individuality and unity are ultimately reconciled.

The ancient Greek philosopher Plotinus, in his work "The Enneads," describes a similar journey of the soul. He writes, "The soul, having descended into the world of sense and become entangled in its multiplicity, must return to the One, the source of all being, through contemplation and the practice of virtue."

Hermetic texts, such as the "Corpus Hermeticum," also reflect these ideas. In the "Poimandres," it is written, "The human being is a great wonder, a divine being in the form of a human. He is immortal and has the power to know all things." G.R.S. Mead, in his translations and commentaries on Hermetic texts, emphasizes the idea of the divine spark within each individual and the journey of the soul back to its divine origin.

Christian mysticism, particularly in the writings of Meister Eckhart, echoes these themes. Eckhart writes, "The soul must abandon all things and be united with the One, where it will find its true home and rest in the divine essence."

In this way, individuality is born from unity, and the physical universe becomes a stage for the divine play of creation, exploration, and eventual return to the oneness of the All. The purpose of this cosmic drama is to experience the infinite facets of existence, to grow in wisdom and love, and to ultimately realize the inherent divinity within all beings.

As we delve deeper into this mystery, we may come to realize that our individual experiences are not separate from the unity, but an integral part of it. In this light, every moment becomes an opportunity for growth, self-discovery, and ultimately, a reconnection with the All that resides outside the bounds of spacetime—where all is known, complete, and eternal.

## Human Nature

Humans are made in the image of divinity itself, yet born in a state of powerlessness to protect us from our own creative vision while we learn to cultivate foresight and maturity.

With time and practice, our ability to visualize desirable outcomes and convert those visions into tangible reality grows steadily greater. There is no limit to this power, which is available to all and possessed in measures which vary between individuals but may be increased at any time.

In this present age, even the least of us may choose to make heaven or hell out of our present circumstances. Despite this capability, most of us will choose to ignore our nearly limitless potential, rarely even contemplating the possible or actively participating in the conversion of possible futures into the present moment. We get stuck in fruitless mindsets and spend most of our time and energy submitting to the creative will of others and hoping for good things to come. Life, in this case, becomes little more than the pursuit of money. This can be an easy way to live, but it does not live up to our divine inheritance.

Wherever you find yourself right now, take a moment to consider how you might make tomorrow better than today, not just for you but also for people around you. Embody the values of courage, kindness, integrity, perseverance, self control, indomitable spirit, wisdom, and community. Make yourself prosperous, and prosper those around you.

The power to convert potential into reality resides within you right now. The question you must answer with your life is whether you will choose to ignore your greatest gifts and endlessly distract yourself with stimulating moments- or make life into a rich, joyful, and prosperous adventure.

Remember that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Start with something small: make something nice for a loved one or a neighbor; visit someone who is lonely; render aid to someone in need. Spend time writing, drawing, and contemplating possible futures, then step into those futures that are most desirable and within your immediate grasp. Then watch in amazement as your reach increases over time and your healing and restorative powers grow ever larger without limit.

Live free and be well!

## Everything is Made of Light

Wherever we look in the universe, at any and every scale, all things are made from the same substance. We call this substance light, and it consists of discreet packets of energy, called photons.

In the realm of photons, time does not exist; the starting point of every photon is exactly the same as its end. All spacetime exists because the infinite and unchanging light of eternity was spun together into knots, slowing and resolving into vibrational patterns that travel through at least 4 dimensions at extraordinarily low speeds compared to those of photons in their unbound state.

Every living creature is a mass of frozen photons living in an endless sea of similarly frozen photons spanning a wide range of vibrational interactions. Every interaction we have ever known occurs through the vibrating energy of our substance, registering the vibrations of those energies that are either deflected by us or pass through our bodies at a minimum rate of trillions of particles per second.

This fundamental substance is not limited to just the physical universe we inhabit. It's likely that similar photon-based structures exist in other dimensions or planes of existence, perhaps with unique properties and interactions.

In this realm of frozen photons, where time appears to be nonexistent, it's possible that consciousness plays a role in shaping reality. The infinite light of eternity could be seen as the source of all potentialities, influencing the vibrational patterns that give rise to our universe and its myriad forms.

Considering that every living creature is composed of frozen photons, it's intriguing to ponder whether this shared substance holds the key to understanding the interconnectedness of all life. Perhaps the vibrations within our bodies are attuned to resonate with those of other beings, fostering empathy and compassion through subtle energetic harmonies.

As we continue to explore the vibrational patterns that underlie our universe, we may uncover hidden relationships between seemingly disparate phenomena. The trillions of photons interacting with our bodies every second could be seen as a manifestation of the cosmic dance, where each photon's vibration contributes to an ever-evolving tapestry of reality.

Ultimately, recognizing the omnipresent nature of photons and their role in shaping our experience might lead us to reevaluate our relationship with the universe. By acknowledging that we are all made of this same substance, perhaps we'll cultivate a deeper sense of unity, cooperation, and harmony within ourselves and with the world around us.

# Fish Bait Recipes

There are many recipes for making effective bait using foods commonly found at home. Each recipe is often directed at only one or two types of fish but, as a general rule, the more specifically a bait targets a fish, the better it will work. This is because each kind of fish prefers its food to smell, taste, or appear similar to the food it would normally eat.

Difficulty: Easy

Note: When baiting a hook, slide as many kernels of corn as will fit onto it until the hook's tip is hidden by the corn.

# About Fish Tycoon Breeding

For publication via Demand Media, 2008

Fish Tycoon is a new and intriguing game that revolves around the concept of breeding, cross-breeding, selling and researching fish and their aquatic environments. The description may sound odd, but the game itself becomes quickly addicting and since it utilizes a real-time environment, it only requires a few moments of game play to bring about hours or days worth of results. The free demo is at least worth a try before purchasing the full version.

## History of

The story behind Fish Tycoon involves the beautiful and mystical island of Isola where seven magical fish have gone mysteriously missing. With the disappearance of the magic fish, the beautiful island quickly becomes desolate and is in serious trouble. Of course, the only way to restore Isola to all of its former glory is to find the seven magic fish and return them to their proper places where their magic can be worked once again. The job won't be easy, but it will certainly be worthwhile to the inhabitants of Isola.

## The Facts

Starting out with Fish Tycoon is a relatively simple process. The game includes a helpful tutorial that will walk you through the game features and explain your objectives. Although you are given the option to freeze time from the main game menu, Fish Tycoon normally operates in a real time environment whether your computer is on or off. This means that if you shut down the game and then come back in a few hours, there will be changes in your aquarium environment and the fish will probably be bigger. Thankfully, there is also an option which allows you to freeze time in the game so that you don't miss out on too much if you know you're going to be gone for a while.

You will start out with an aquarium and two fish that you will need to grow, breed, and sell to begin making money. There are more than 400 breeds in the game that can be discovered through cross breeding and through purchasing new eggs. This means that some breeds will be available to you through the fish you begin with and that some must be purchased and experimented with to see what kinds of new species you can create. The more beautiful species, of course, are worth more when you sell them, so your objective is to create the best looking fish breeds you can.

The main objective in Fish Tycoon is to find the seven magic breeds of fish. This will not be an easy task, and there is no one winning strategy to accomplish the goal. It will involve a great deal of the game's time and research, but the real time aspect of the game ensures that you won't have to spend hours of your own time making things happen. You can simply allow the program to run in the background while you go about your normal business and check in on your fish from time to time. The combination of simple game play with a real time twist will be a turnoff to some while many others might be instantly hooked.

## Expert Insight

If you are considering purchasing Fish Tycoon, it is recommended that you download the trial version before making the big decision.

The overall purpose of gaming is always to get the most out of your purchase, which is why a free demo can be obtained at most gaming sites to help you decide if this one is for you.

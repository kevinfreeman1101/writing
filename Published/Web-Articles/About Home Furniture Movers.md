# About Home Furniture Movers

Moving household goods is typically a strenuous and stressful process that entails a great deal of planning, communication and organization. Home furniture movers specialize in these areas, helping to ease the stress and difficulty of moving, and making the process easier for homeowners.

## History

Home furniture movers have been organizing and conducting household moves since long before the advent of the automobile. In early times, movers had no specialized equipment to assist with the process, but still managed to efficiently load people's goods into wagons safely in order to ensure the safest possible travel. With the many enhancements in moving due to modern technology, many aspects of a household move have changed, but the home furniture mover's job remains essentially the same.

## Function

Home furniture movers typically begin the household moving process by packing the homeowner's goods into boxes--although some homeowners prefer to pack the goods themselves--and preparing the furniture items for transport. Usually, furniture preparation involves covering each furniture item in thick, woven pads, and securing any moving parts so that the item can be carried. Finally, movers will load the items systematically into a moving van so that they can be transported and unloaded with minimal stress to the shipment.

## Types

Some home furniture movers specialize in the efficient movement of all items from the house to the moving van, while others might never enter the home, remaining instead in the moving van where the loading process takes place. While it is debated which job is the more difficult, each requires an often surprising level of skill and knowledge in order to ensure that the process takes place in the most effective manner.

## Considerations

Home furniture movers have many things to consider before the move can effectively take place. One of these is the preparation of the home and the walkway from entry and exit points to the moving van. In environments where dirt, mud and moisture can be tracked into the home during a move, home furniture movers must first protect the flooring of the home, usually with a protective plastic that temporarily adheres to the floors. Door frames must also be padded, and outside walkways are sometimes covered with wood planks if the ground is particularly muddy or difficult to walk on.

## Expert Insight

When selecting home furniture movers, it may be prudent to inquire if the movers have been certified through any training programs, or are familiar with the use of all household protective equipment and moving gear. There are a great deal of laborers in the household moving market who call themselves movers, but do not have the knowledge or skills necessary for conducting a move safely and without unnecessary damage to household items. While certified movers are often more expensive than less knowledgeable laborers, the added cost can more than pay for itself through a reduction in possible damages and the ability complete the job quickly and efficiently.

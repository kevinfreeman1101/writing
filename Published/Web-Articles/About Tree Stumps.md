# About Tree Stumps

Tree stumps can be an unpleasant eyesore to any lawn or landscape. Because of the difficulty that many homeowners have in removing them, they are often left completely untouched. But there are some relatively quick, simple, or creative methods for removing tree stumps that homeowners should be aware of.

## Significance

There are many methods for removing old tree stumps, ranging from stump grinding to excavating with heavy equipment or attempting to pull the stump from the ground with a personal truck. While any of these options are viable when exercised properly (although using a personal vehicle can possibly incur expensive damages), some are much easier and quicker. Others might take more time, but are far more cost effective.

## Features

When cost is less of an issue, the fastest and easiest stump removal method is to rent a stump grinder from an equipment rental facility, and use the grinder to remove the remaining trunk down to just below the ground level. Over a long period of time (typically 2 to 5 years), the underground portion of the stump will decompose, and can be dug out with a mattock and shovel if desired.

## Effects

If a stump needs to be fully removed in a more timely fashion, there are two types of options to accomplish this: hard labor or heavy equipment. In either case, the earth will need to be dug out from around the root ball. Each root must be severed, including the taproot directly underneath the stump, before the stump can be easily pulled from the ground. While a mattock or an axe and shovel can accomplish this, renting a backhoe for an hour can save a significant amount of time and effort in accomplishing this task.

## Considerations

For stump removal projects where cost is a significant factor, one tried and true method is to use a large drill bit to bore holes evenly into the stump face about 6 inches deep. Pack each hole with a nitrogen rich fertilizer (or specialized stump decomposer) and generously wet the stump and surrounding earth. Finally, cover the stump with a plastic tarp so that the moisture becomes trapped and begins to seep into the wood, taking the nitrogen with it to speed decomposition. Continue regularly watering the stump and periodically re-applying the fertilizer until the stump becomes soft enough to easily remove.

## Expert Insight

Because of the great degree of difficulty in removing a stump, some creative homeowners can choose instead to carve the stump into a decorative chair or pedestal and use it to enhance the landscape. If the stump is large enough, it can even be shaped into a creative table for outdoor enjoyment by using a chainsaw along with some patience and inspiration. Have fun with the idea to change an annoying eyesore into a unique and lovely centerpiece that visitors will adore.

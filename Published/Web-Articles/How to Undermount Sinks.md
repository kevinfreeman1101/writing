## Overview

Although drop-in sinks are far more common than their undermount counterparts – no pun intended – the undermount sink is less obtrusive and easier to maintain in the long run. To install an undermount sink, there are a few basic steps that will save you time, money, and a great deal of hassle during the process.

Skills: Moderate

## Things You'll Need

- Basin wrench
- Drill
- Silicone caulking
- Scrap wood
- Wire/clamps
- Pipe wrench (optional)
- Reciprocating saw (optional)
- Socket wrench (optional)

## Step 1

Prep the area. Before beginning any installation, it is essential to ensure that the area is properly prepared to receive the new sink. If the new sink is replacing an old one, be sure to scrape all of the old caulking and debris from the previous sink’s rim area, finishing the process by cleaning the countertop surfaces with denatured alcohol to ensure good bonding when the new silicone is applied. If the sink will be installed in a completely new countertop, make sure that the receiving holes are the proper sizes and shapes to fit the new sink’s design.

## Step 2

Temporarily secure the sink in place. Place the new sink in the exact location where it will sit and secure it in place with a long piece of sturdy scrap wood, bridging the open area over the sink’s top and using clamps or wire wrapped around a second piece of wood under the sink to hold it firmly in place.

## Step 3

Mark all mounting clip and insert locations. With a pencil or marker, mark out the locations of the new sink’s mounting clips and insert locations. After every mounting point has been double checked, the sink can be removed again and placed to the side.

## Step 4

Drill the insert holes. Common sink inserts need to be placed in quarter-inch diameter holes, which should provide a very tight fit when installing them. Using a steel hammer, drive the inserts into their holes, making sure that each fits tightly enough to bear the weight of a loaded sink.

## Step 5

Apply silicone to the sink’s edge. After cleaning the sink’s edge with denatured alcohol, apply a generous bead of silicone to the desired rim area.

## Step 6

Replace and secure the sink in the installation area. Using the same method as noted in step two, replace the sink in the installation area, being careful of the silicone bead throughout the process. After exact placement, install the wing nuts onto the mounting bolts to hold the sink permanently in place.

## Step 7

Mark and drill the faucet locations. For new countertops, mark out the new faucet locations and drill the appropriately sized (typically one-and-one-quarter-inch) holes in the mounting area. Be sure to use the proper sizes and types of drill attachments during this process as improper attachments can permanently damage or destroy the existing countertop.

## Step 8

Install the faucet. Install the new faucet using the documentation provided from the faucet’s manufacturer. When installing a new faucet onto a granite surface, let the granite cure overnight before hooking up the plumbing or allowing water to run over the warm material. Use a basin wrench to attach plumbing lines to the faucet bases to ensure a tight installation.

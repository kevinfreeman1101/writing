# About Moving Vans

One of the most cost efficient solutions for moving, whether it is across the country or in town, involves renting a moving van and calling up some friends and family to help for the day. But there are also a number of considerations to keep in mind before renting a moving van. Read on to learn more about moving vans.

## Time Frame

One of the first things to consider before renting a moving van is the size of the van. This is an important issue because the difference in size will directly relate to how long the move will take. Smaller moving vans will need to be loaded very tightly from floor to ceiling, and may still require multiple trips to accomplish the task. A good rule of thumb when considering moving van sizes is to buy the next size larger than you may need just to ensure that the whole move can take place in one or two trips, and be sure to reserve the van at least two weeks in advance.

## Types

There are a number of moving van styles to choose from, each of them with a specialized purpose. Moving vans with a storage area overhanging the cab of the van are useful for moves in which there are a great deal of fragile boxes and unpackable items that will need to ride in this protected area. A moving van with a taller cargo area might also be needed to accommodate taller furniture items and long couches that will usually travel safest on their sides. If very heavy items are being moved, such as pianos or safes, some moving vans even come with a lift-gate option for getting the items safely in the cargo area.

## Considerations

When the reservations for the moving van have been made, another thing to consider is whether professional moving laborers will be needed. There are usually plenty of ads in the local newspaper or on Craigslist offering moving services at an hourly rate, and the addition of a professional can work wonders in helping the process run smoothly. Moving professionals are typically trained in proper loading techniques, furniture preparation and can save a great deal of time and hassles with their expertise.

## Expert Insight

When renting a moving van, there is also some equipment that can often be rented through the same establishment to accomplish the move safely. Furniture straps and dollies are priceless tools for most moving situations, but items such as floor protection, furniture pads, bubble wrap for delicate furniture pieces and load bars or straps to secure the items in the van are useful in preventing furniture and property damage.

## Warning

Renting a moving van is a great way to save in moving costs, but it can also be dangerous for drivers who are inexperienced with handling large, top-heavy vehicles. If the moving van is packed tightly, its center of gravity will be much higher than that of a normal van or truck. A fully loaded moving van should be handled with great care, especially when making tight turns or braking hard in emergencies. Inexperienced drivers should try driving on less frequented streets before sharing roads with heavy traffic or traveling at high speeds. When handling a moving van, safety should always be the number one consideration.

# About Bench Grinders

Bench grinders are versatile, effective appliances with a variety of uses within a craftperson's workshop. The best grinder to suit your needs depends on which tasks you will use the grinder for, which kinds of tools or materials you will work on the grinder and the level of detail needed in the angle of the grind.

## Function

Bench grinders are helpful, time-saving appliances that are most commonly used to sharpen tools but are also useful for smoothing out rough metal surfaces and buffing surfaces into a mirrorlike sheen with considerably less effort than manual tools require. Because most tools are made from hardened steel, hand files and sharpening stones are relatively ineffective for removing unwanted layers of metal to restore an edge. This makes the efficiency of the bench grinder a welcome addition to many garages.

## Expert Insight

Although bench grinders are generally uniform in overall appearance and functionality, there are a variety of models to choose from that offer a range of power levels, speeds and accessories. According to a study performed by "Popular Mechanics," the Dewalt DW756 offers a more effective and versatile solution than most bench grinders on the market, but the study also recommends the Black and Decker BT3500 for those looking for a more cost-effective solution.

## Types

The first and foremost difference between the various types of bench grinders is the power of the motor that spins the grinding wheels. More power allows the grinder to be used for more difficult jobs, making grinders with smaller motors less attractive to the craftperson who wants to tackle those jobs. A good bench grinder will also have a speed selector so that the rotation speed can be slowed down enough for fine grinding.

## Features

One useful feature of bench grinders is the style and type of removable wheels that they come with. Most grinders come equipped with a coarse wheel for bulk grinding and a somewhat smoother wheel for performing the finish work. Standard grinding wheels can quickly heat the metal, drawing out its temper. The alternative to a standard grinding wheel is a lighter-colored grinding wheel that breaks down more quickly as it is used but also remains cooler so that the temper is unaffected. Other types of wheels include wire brush wheels for removing metal burs and buffing wheels to polish metal surfaces.

## Considerations

Bench grinders often come with a variety of accessories such as optional V-groove tool rests, tool rest angle selectors, top-mounted lights and water trays. While the pros and cons of each optional feature are many and useful, a typical craftsman will not require them for working around the house. In addition, if some of these extra features are still desired, they can usually be purchased and installed separately from the bench grinder as needed.

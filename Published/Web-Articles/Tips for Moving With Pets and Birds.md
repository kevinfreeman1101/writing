# Tips for Moving With Pets and Birds

During the moving process, there are a great many special considerations and items that simply don’t fit into a standard moving plan. Pets and birds certainly fit into this category, which is why moving pet and bird owners should plan ahead in order to work around the difficulties. 

## Before the Big Day

Pets and birds often become nervous and uncertain on moving day, and may exhibit strange behavior as they communicate their uncertainty. In addition, nothing is more saddening or frustrating than closing the back doors of a moving van only to discover that a loved pet is missing, and may have slipped into the load while no one was looking. Before the big day arrives, try to arrange for the animals to be left at a friend or relative’s house while everything is loaded; this not only keeps them out of the way where they won’t be harmed, but will help them to stay a bit more relaxed while their familiar toys and furniture are packed and loaded. 

## The Long Trip Ahead

If you plan to move your pets over a long distance, extra considerations will need to be taken to accommodate their travel needs. This may include extra potty stops during a drive or even sedation if the pets aren’t good travelers. If you aren’t sure how the pets will react to the experience, it can be beneficial to take a trial run to determine if they become overly agitated or upset while travelling. In the event that there simply isn’t enough room or time to take special care of the pets, check with your local airlines to see how much it might cost to have them flown to the destination instead; pet flights are often cheaper than many people anticipate, and can be a very convenient alternative to consider. 

## Arriving at the New Home

When Pets and birds arrive at their new home, they may remain nervous or agitated for a time as they adjust to their new climate and surroundings. Moving is an experience that pets aren’t used to, and sometimes they act strangely as a result. If your pets are escape artists or extra noisemakers, be sure that their living areas are secure and that there are a number of familiar items around to help imprint the idea that the new home is there to stay. If the pets make too much noise in the night – as lonely pets are apt to do – talk with your local veterinary specialist for some dieting and animal prescription tips that will help both the pet and owner to adjust to the new environment.

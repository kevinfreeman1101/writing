Knowing about the bluebird’s natural habitat is an important first step for bird enthusiasts who are seeking to study the species in the wild. Although there are three types of bluebirds in North America, the natural habitats for each species are very similar, and can be easily located by a searcher who knows what to look for. Bluebirds can be found in mountainous areas as well as in valleys and plains, but the most common feature linking them together is that they are frequently near open spaces and they tend to build nests in old woodpecker holes inside hardwood trees.

## Geography

There are three kinds of bluebirds currently living in North America: the Eastern bluebird is found east of the Rocky Mountains, the Western bluebird is found west of the Rocky Mountains, and the Mountain bluebird is found in the higher elevations of the Rockies from Canada to Arizona. The Mountain bluebird can be easily identified by its slightly larger size as well as its solid blue coloring. The Eastern bluebird is smaller in stature and has a red breast and chin with a white belly. The Western bluebird is similar to its Eastern cousin, but it has a blue chin while the red color on its breast reaches further around to its back.

## The Facts

Bluebirds will typically seek out meadows and open areas that can either be high up in the mountains or down in the lowest of valleys. They prefer wide open spaces such as fields, prairies, and meadows for their dwellings, and will generally stay close to their chosen homes until they migrate. Bluebirds have also been known to seek out manmade habitats in fields, pastures, golf courses where a steady food supply and water source can be found nearby. Because bluebirds prefer open spaces, heavily populated areas such as cities tend to be devoid of bluebirds altogether.

## The Facts

Bluebirds will not eat birdseed, and will seek out mealworms and insects as their primary food source, resorting to common earthworms for their diets only by absolute necessity. Bluebird young cannot stomach the earthworms, probably because of the grainy dirt contained in the worms' stomachs, and will become sick and dehydrated if forced to rely on them as their primary food source. About 68 percent of a bluebird’s diet consists of insects such as grasshoppers, caterpillars, spiders and beetles, while the remaining 32 percent comes from fruit such as grapes and berries.

## Misconceptions

It is a common misconception that bluebirds are a heavily populated and thriving species. Since the introduction of the house sparrow into areas that were once dominated by bluebirds, population numbers have dropped to an estimated 90 percent of what they once were. This is because birds such as the house sparrow, in addition to a variety of other animals, will take over the bluebird’s dwelling, leaving it with no suitable place to build a nest.

## Expert Insight

When looking for bluebirds in their natural habitat, there are some helpful ways to determine where to find them. Since bluebirds do not make their own homes, they will typically inhabit old woodpecker holes that are about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. They do not usually live in cities due to an increased number of predators and a lack of the open spaces they prefer. Natural bluebird predators include raccoons, snakes and cats, so seek out areas that are not populated heavily with these animals. Competitive birds will take over bluebird nests, so if you see a number of house sparrows or house wrens while searching, you can accurately assume they have moved on to nest elsewhere.

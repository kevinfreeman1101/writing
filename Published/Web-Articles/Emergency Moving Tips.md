# Emergency Moving Tips

In the event of a flood, fire, or other emergency event, knowing the best methods for emergency moving can not only save household items that wouldn’t otherwise survive, but can also help homeowners to get the greatest amount of items into safe places before it is too late. Emergency moving is never pleasant, but having the necessary knowledge ready and available beforehand always pays off in the end. 

## Make a Plan

Before rushing in to attack furniture and items and random, start by forming a quick plan of action that will help reduce the efforts and trips needed to get everything out. Take small items that are endangered and stack them into available furniture or boxes before making trips to a safe place, being careful not to overload any items in the process. Prioritize which items are the most important and protect them before the rest, making extra trips where necessary to ensure their safety. If there is time, be sure to call a trusted friend and have him or her call others who might be able to rush in and help while there is still time. 

## Hunt and Gather

As furniture and other easily damaged items are hastily stacked in the safe zone, they can easily become damaged as they are stacked, leaned, or otherwise crammed in ways that they normally wouldn’t be handled. Before getting too deep into the process, gather all of your sheets, blankets, pillows, and couch cushions into a location that is close to the safe zone where everything will be stacked. As items come in or go out, use the cushioning materials to protect your valuable pieces before scratches, dents, and cracks have a chance to reduce your antiques to a pile of rubbish. 

## Move it or Raise it

If the emergency event involves a basement flood or sewer backup, one of the most important first steps to take is to raise up furniture that can’t be quickly moved by placing it on blocks of wood, strong foam, or anything nearby that can be sacrificed for the greater good. Often, people who aren’t strong enough to simply haul their belongings out on their backs can still lean them over for this purpose, keeping valuables safe and dry above the water line. 

## Damage Control

Most kinds of wood can endure short periods of smoke and moisture, but will soak liquids and gases into their pores over time, swelling and smelling until they are too far gone for salvaging. Any items that weren’t so lucky during the moving process will need some special care as soon as possible; if they were soaked or exposed to a large amount of smoke, try to get them clean and dry as quickly as possible, before the exposure has a chance to seep in.

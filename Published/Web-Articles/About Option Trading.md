# About Option Trading

Options are powerful tools that investors can use to gain a greater amount of leverage in the stock market using a smaller amount of capital. Unlike stocks, options are intangible assets whose values are derived from the real value of their stock counterparts. They are simply contracts that give the owner the right to buy or sell a specified stock at a given price during a given time period.

## Function

An option contract is born when an investor decides to sell a contract that gives the purchaser the right to buy 100 shares of a given stock at a given price on the open market. For instance, if John Doe owns 100 shares of the XYZ corporation, which is currently trading at $20 per share, and John believes that the stock price is getting ready to plummet, he can sell one contract that gives the purchaser the right to buy his 100 shares at $22.00 per share on the third Friday of next month.

## Benefits

John Doe wants to sell his contract on the market because he believes that on the day that the contract buyer is given the right to buy his 100 shares of XYZ for $22.00 per share, the actual price will be much lower than that; $18.00 per share, for example. In such a case, the owner of the contract that John sold will not exercise his option and, therefore, John gets to keep the money paid for the contract as well as his original 100 shares.

## Risk Factors

The attraction to options contracts lies in the fact that John Doe may be mistaken in his belief that XYZ corporation is about to plummet. Let's say that after John sells his contract giving the purchaser the right to buy his 100 shares at $22.00 per share, the price of XYZ suddenly rises instead. If the price has risen to, say, $24.00 per share, then John must still sell his shares at $22.00, thus preventing him from gaining the $200.00 profit that he might have obtained through keeping the stock.

## Expert Insight

There are many different types of options and options strategies that can allow investors to take on equally varied levels of risk. Call options give the purchaser, or owner, the right to buy a stock. Put options give the owner the right to sell a stock. The concept of put options can be confusing since the investor purchasing a put contract does not need to own the underlying stock in order to sell it. Instead, he or she is reserving the right to sell the contract writerâ€™s 100 shares on the agreed upon date.

While the idea of options can be exciting to investors because of the amount of leverage they provide with a smaller amount of capital, options investors must understand that contracts often expire worthless to their owners. Investing in the stock market is no guarantee of profit, but it can be safer than investing in options because a stock price generally represents the value of its company while an options contract is generally valued through sheer speculation, which is prone to much greater volatility.

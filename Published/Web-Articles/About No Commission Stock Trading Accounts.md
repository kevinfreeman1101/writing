# About No Commission Stock Trading Accounts

There are multitudes of investment options available on the market, and an even greater number of professionals who would be delighted to charge heavy fees for using their service. In this type of environment, can it be possible to invest for free?

## Significance

Most stock trading accounts, even the self-directed variety, charge fees for every stock trade, which can greatly reduce your investment capital over time. Only recently have investors been presented with the ability to bypass these fees and trade stocks for absolutely no cost, which allows frequent traders to reinvest those extra funds to produce a more powerful portfolio.

## Function

Often, investors wonder how it is possible to offer free trading accounts while maintaining a profitable business. This is an important question, and the answer for each provider can be the deciding factor in choosing the right firm. Zecco, for instance, gives qualifying clients 10 free trades per month; any further trades incur a fee of $4.50 per trade. In addition, Zecco offers loans for its margin accounts, making a profit through the interest charged. Another example is Bank of America, which offers 30 free trades per month to account holders who keep a minimum balance of $25,000 in its separate deposit accounts.

## Features

After learning how no-commission stock trading firms can stay in business, the next question to inevitably arise is: "What's the catch?" In the case of Zecco, a balance of $2,500 must be maintained in the investment portfolio at all times. Bank of America's requirement is somewhat differentâ€”although it offers three times the free trades, the $25,000 minimum balance must be kept in a standard checking, savings or CD account, where it will likely earn a much lower return.

## Considerations

Consider the type of guidance available before switching to a firm that offers no-commission stock trading accounts. In lieu of professional research and advice, Zecco offers forums where independent investors or groups of investors can choose to make their transactions visible to others to promote discussion and learning for everyone. Bank of America, however, offers access to extensive research and advice from professional investors.

## Potential

The possibilities that no-commission stock trading account firms offer their clients are numerous and can be highly beneficial for those who wish to make the most use of their investment capital. Choose an account that properly suits your investment style and needs, and weigh the varying benefits carefully before making a final decision. Above all, always invest using the best research and advice available, whether it is obtained through the investment firm or through a separate source.

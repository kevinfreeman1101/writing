# About Infrared Scouting Cameras

Wildlife enthusiasts and sportsmen have always sought after an edge to help them find the best areas to locate specific kinds of animals. Without camping out in the mountains for a few months, it is difficult to determine how frequently a deer or elk herd passes through and area. Thankfully, the infrared camera has helped to alleviate this problem.

## Types

Infrared scouting cameras are available through sports retailer outlets such as Cabella's and Sportsman's Warehouse, and the price range can vary from $100 to more than $400 depending on the features (see Resources below). They can be obtained in various shapes and sizes, and can mount either on camouflaged tripods or on the sides of trees.

## Significance

Understanding wildlife behavior and tracking their frequent travels is essential to both wildlife enthusiasts and sportsmen so that the game can be better located at a later time. Since most people have a limited amount of time to track down their quarry, technologists invented the infrared camera so that pictures or video clips of the desired game can be obtained, day or night, by carefully placing the camera near a well-traveled game trail in the desired area.

## Features

One of the more significant innovations that infrared scouting cameras offer is a moving heat sensitivity adjustment, which allows the camera to ignore smaller animals such as birds and squirrels while capturing the desired larger game. In addition, anti-theft mounting devices and password protection are also standard features that provide a way to ensure that the camera isn't stolen. Perhaps the best feature now offered is the high resolution, full-color pictures during the day and high resolution grayscale pictures during the night.

## Time Frame

One of the problems that early models of infrared cameras had was the short battery life, especially when left out in the cold for long periods of time. Camera owners were forced to deal with this problem by frequently traveling back to the camera location simply to change the batteries. Thankfully, today's models now offer a battery life of around six months as well as a higher storage capacity so that more pictures can be obtained without having to commute into the hills.

## Expert Insight

There are a few major types of infrared scouting cameras available to choose from. The more economic Wildview cameras offer basic features, optional flash and the same grade resolution as the higher-end cameras. On the higher end of the price range, Cuddleback offers a more customizable camera that is able to track a more specific size of animal, but also carries a cost of about three times that of the Wildview.

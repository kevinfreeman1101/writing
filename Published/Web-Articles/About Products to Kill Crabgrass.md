# About Products to Kill Crabgrass

Digitaria, also known as crabgrass, is a common weed that often dominates cultivated lawns and gardens, overtaking areas intended for other plants. Crabgrass plants multiply through germination, spreading seed throughout the entire warm season that can eventually take over lawns and gardens if not treated properly. Knowing which steps need to be taken and when to take them can make the difference between a beautiful lawn and a weedy disaster area.

## History of

Crabgrass is a weed that can continually spread its seed for entire seasons, bringing about the potential for a lawn takeover by the beginning of the next season. It grows in moderate to warm climates throughout both hemispheres. In some places it provides good nutrition for grazing cattle. In some areas of the world, the seeds it produces are toasted and ground into flour for consumption.

## Features

Although there are different kinds of crabgrass, the most common varieties possess flat, wide, grass-like blades. They grow long stalks with seed stalks that resemble five fingers on the uppermost portion. It is the finger-like seed stalks that give the plant its scientific name, Digitaria. Each plant can grow to about 1-foot in diameter and will quickly overtake cultivated lawns as individual plants spread approximately 150,000 seeds that will grow to replace surrounding plants.

## Expert Insight

The most efficient way to eliminate crabgrass in a cultivated area is to prevent seeds from germinating when they are spread. This will involve using a pre-emergent herbicide that prevents spreading seeds from finding the soil they need in order to grow. In order for this measure to be effective, multiple doses of the herbicide may be necessary and they will need to be applied at a very specific time.

## Benefits

One of the most effective pre-emergent herbicides for use on crabgrass is sidurion, which is the main ingredient in a product called Tupersan. The benefit of using Tupersan is that it will prevent crabgrass seeds from germinating while it still allows new lawn seeds to germinate and thrive. Even though Tupersan targets crabgrass specifically, it is still recommended that its users do not use it on newly-seeded lawns until the desired grass has grown tall enough to be mowed about three times.

## Expert Insight

An alternative to using Tupersan is the pre-emergent herbicide called Dimension. This product works effectively on crabgrass, but it may also interfere with newly-seeded lawns. The benefit of using Dimension, however, is that it is moderately effective on crabgrass that has already emerged, thus taking on the designation of post-emergent as well as pre-emergent herbicide.

## Time Frame

Because pre-emergent herbicides kill the crabgrass before its seedlings emerge, the specific time to use them is when the soil first reaches a temperature of about 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit. A popular technique for finding this narrow window is to watch the blooming of the forsythia plant. When forsythia begins to bloom, wait about two weeks to apply the pre-emergent herbicide at its recommended strength across the desired area. Another plant to watch is the lilac, since it will bloom around the same time as the crabgrass. The rule of thumb to use when applying this principle is to get the herbicide down after the forsythia blooms but before the lilac has the opportunity.

## Expert Insight

When using pre-emergent herbicides to control crabgrass, keep in mind that the evenly spread herbicide is only intended to provide a surface barrier that the crabgrass cannot pass through. If the soil's surface is broken during the germination period, it is recommended to re-apply the desired herbicide in the area where the surface was penetrated. If you are planning to engage in digging or lawn aeration, try scheduling the activities around the germination period of the crabgrass.

# What is Asbestos Abatement?

Asbestos is an extremely hazardous material that can be found in many areas, from the home to the workplace. When the presence of asbestos is suspected, what should home and business owners do to ensure that people are not at risk?

## Warning

When asbestos is present in or near a populated area, there are some things to take into consideration before incurring the expense of professional abatement. Is the asbestos exposed to air flow that might cause its tiny particles to spread to the populated areas? If the asbestos is properly isolated, it may not pose a significant risk, but building owners can be held responsible if occupants or neighbors are exposed to the deadly particles.

## Identification

When it is suspected that asbestos is present, an accredited asbestos testing specialist should be used to determine if the substance is indeed asbestos. Although there are many commercial products that test for the presence of asbestos, simply taking a sample for testing can release innumerable particles into the air, endangering the tester and any people in the area. Instead, have an expert come to the suspected area to safely take a sample and have it tested.

## Prevention/Solution

When the determination has been made that abatement is the wisest option, choose an abatement specialist that is properly accredited by the EPA. There are many contractors who claim to have the knowledge and skills required to safely dispose of asbestos, but only accredited asbestos specialists are recommended by the EPA. Asbestos removal is a much more technical process than most people would believe, and the proper steps must be taken to ensure that people are not placed in a greater danger than if the material was simply left alone.

## Function

Asbestos abatement is performed by effectively sealing the area off where the asbestos is located, wetting the material to reduce its airborne capability, and safely removing and disposing of it so that it no longer poses a threat. To effectively seal an area off means that all air vents, doors and windows must be taped or sealed off with plastic. Any removal specialists must wear full protective suits, breathing apparatuses and eye protection.

## Expert Insight

When the asbestos has been removed, it may be safely sealed and disposed of as hazardous waste at a landfill or converted into a non friable silicate through exposure to high levels of heat. When possible, the latter option is recommended as it permanently removes the threat that asbestos poses. Another benefit of conversion is that the asbestos can be recycled to make tiles and bricks that are no longer considered dangerous to their environment.

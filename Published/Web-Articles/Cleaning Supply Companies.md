# Cleaning Supply Companies

Utilizing direct purchases from cleaning supply companies can help homeowners and cleaning businesses save a bundle. There are a number of cleaning supply companies available to choose from, each of which offers a variety of supplies at varying rates. Here's a look at some of the more prominent companies in this industry.

## Considerations

There are some things for consumers to consider when searching for a cleaning supply company to provide them with their preferred products. One of the main factors involved will be the unit sizes that can be ordered from the cleaning supply company. If a consumer wishes to store a six-month supply of products, but can only order the products in one-year supply increments, a better storage solution or an alternative cleaning supply company will have to be used. Another consideration is the return policy if items ordered are not the same as they appeared in the catalog. If a customer ordered a new mop with the idea that it was strong and durable, but received a light plastic version instead, the company might be willing to pay for the return shipping charges, but the responsibility is just as likely to fall on the consumer instead.

## JanitorialSupplies4Less

JanitorialSupplies4Less is a cleaning supply company that offers a wide range of products for consumers. The diverse array of products offered through this company is a helpful feature for those who are looking for a one stop location to meet all of their needs. From cleaning chemicals to floor care products to a full line of facilities maintenance supplies, JanitorialSupplies4Less certainly has their bases covered for a reasonable range of prices.

## Don Aslett's Cleaning Center

Don Aslett's Cleaning Center offers a versatile selection product as well as a few extras that might be helpful for homeowners or cleaning staff alike. Especially impressive was their 3.5-minute bathroom cleaning kit, complete with spray bottle, bowl caddy, their specialized johnny mop and a video on their website to prove that the 3.5-minute bathroom cleaning plan can truly be done. Don Aslett's Cleaning Center also has a retail location for Twin Falls, Idaho, residents who wish to view the products before they buy.

## Uline

Uline is a company that offers a number of janitorial supplies to consumers. Not only does Uline have a good selection of products to choose from, but they also offer the Uline brand as a cheaper alternative to many of the name brand items they sell. For instance, the Uline standard paper towel case of 30 rolls costs about half of the price for the same amount of Bounty paper towel rolls. While Uline doesn't have a competitive product in every category, their website is certainly worth a look to see how much savings they offer.

## Expert Insight

Because of the shipping discounts that many cleaning supply companies offer for bulk orders, consumers may wish to order from companies that offer a wide range of products to meet their needs. In this way, they will not be forced to order from two or more companies to ensure that every product is available, and the shipping discount for the bulk order can also increase the overall savings.

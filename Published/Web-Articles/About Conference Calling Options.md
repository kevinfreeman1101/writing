# About Conference Calling Options

Having the right conference calling services is an absolutely essential business tool. With telecommuting employees who must be contacted frequently and major business negotiations or transactions being conducted via teleconferencing, the right conference calling service needs to be reliable, provide all needed options, and must certainly be cost effective.

## Criteria

The first thing you should do when choosing a conference calling service provider is put together a list of basic criteria that must be met at all costs. Conversely, a list of optional features should also be developed in order to determine the level of service that might be provided without exceeding cost prohibitions. Typically, the features of a conference calling service for general use are:Â   
  
  
  
1. Telephone based service (Essential)  
  
2. Automatic participator name announcements (Essential)  
  
3. Recording service for later review (Optional)  
  
4. Video conference features (Optional)  
  
  
  
Developing this list first can save a great deal of hassles and costs as the pros and cons of each option are weighed.

## Features

The list of features that most conferencing services offer is often long, and many features will be more than helpful while others will be unnecessary. For instance, service options may include an operator to assist with the call, or instead be an instant and automated service. There are options that allow newcomers to be introduced to the group as they un-mute their phones to be heard, and there are separate options that record each conference so that latecomers can review everything they missed. Each provider will offer only some of these features, while some might offer all at no additional cost.

## Types

There are several major types of conference calling options available to most businesses: Web-based conferencing, telephone based conferencing and video conferencing. Choosing between the types will involve comparing the list of criteria to each kind of provider to determine which of them provide the services needed or preferred. Next, the cost factor comes into play. Web-based conferencing software will need to be installed in various offices throughout the company as well as outside offices that may need to be included in conferences. This can be costly, but can help drive long-term costs down as the monthly service fees may be lower. If numerous outside businesses are frequently included in teleconferences, however, a telephone option may be the more cost effective solution. Video conferencing also adds a touch of personalization that often rings of professionalism before the conference even begins.

## Cost

The all-important budget is always a significant deciding factor when considering conference calling service providers. Some services are provided absolutely free of charge and look great on paper, but their features and reliability should be closely examined before making the final decision. Other services will charge premium fees for options such as video, application sharing, desktop sharing or white boarding. These extras are very useful for many users, but may be unnecessary for others. Cost is always an important deciding factor, but rather than taking costs to either extreme, a middle ground can often be found between high costs and low-end services that will meet everyone's needs.

## Expert Insight

While there are many criteria and features that will influence the ultimate decision of which conference calling options are best for a company, the ultimate deciding factor is often one of aesthetics. The services chosen can send clear messages to other businesses that the company is a high level organization of dedicated professionals, or it can smack of tight budgets and unwillingness to modernize business practices. Be sure to keep the presentation factor in mind when choosing the conference calling options that best fit your organization.

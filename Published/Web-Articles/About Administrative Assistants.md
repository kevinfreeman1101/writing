# About Administrative Assistants

Administrative assistant jobs are one of the most commonly listed jobs on the market. Every job description is slightly different, but many are still left wondering what the role of administrative assistant entails. What qualifications are necessary to hold such a position?

## History

The role of administrative assistant originally held the title of secretary, and old-fashioned views traditionally reserved the job for women only. Looking at today's society shows how far our views on both jobs and gender roles have progressed. Although a secretary was once thought of as a personal assistant to "the boss," an administrative assistant plays a much more complex and defined role in modern business.

## Function

According to the United States Department of Labor, administrative assistants have the responsibilities of managing and maintaining communications and information, clerical and administrative duties, planning, scheduling, office organization, research, information handling and guest services. These tasks are typical of an administrative assistant position, but the job typically carries these responsibilities and more.

## Types

Some administrative assistants are highly specialized in their duties, even to the exclusion of the other duties typically associated with the position. Other administrative assistants still hold the more traditional role of secretary or personal assistant to administrative staff. In some cases, administrative assistants are charged with handling a group of lower-level administrative assistants. This role can be a difficult one to pin down to a specific set of standards because a large degree of working flexibility is often required.

## Features

Some of the more accurate descriptions regarding administrative assistants are professional jugglers, the wizard behind the curtain, and the glue that holds the ship together. Administrative assistants are usually featured as the behind-the-scenes people who provide the vital support for daily operations. While administrative assistants might be assigned to one person in particular, they can quickly find themselves supporting an entire group of people who urgently need assistance in order to meet their deadlines.

## Expert Insight

Entry-level administrative assistant jobs typically require nothing more than a high school diploma and some basic clerical skills such as filing, typing and researching. Pay has a wide range, depending on experience and expertise. Expert-level administrative assistant positions often require an associate's degree in the field.

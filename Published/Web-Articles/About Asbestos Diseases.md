There are more than a few diseases caused by exposure to asbestos in humans. Symptoms vary between the diseases, but are generally respiratory and chronic, and become worse over long periods of time. Read on to find out more about the diseases caused by exposure to asbestos.

## History

Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous mineral that is found in various forms throughout the natural world. It can be found in low levels in the air, water, and soil. The most common exposures to asbestos that result in the contraction of asbestos-related diseases and an increased risk for contracting other diseases are usually work-related.   
  
Typically, workers exposed to asbestos who were studied did not contract asbestos-related diseases unless exposure was regular over a long period of time. Those who were exposed to high concentrations of asbestos only one time showed no signs of respiratory or other related health degeneration.

## Significance

The most common diseases caused by asbestos are mesothelioma, lung cancer, asbestosis, and increases in the risks of contracting many other types of cancers including throat, esophagus, kidney and gallbladder cancers.   
  
Of the diseases directly caused by high levels of asbestos exposure, symptoms are generally similar. Symptoms include wheezing, hoarseness, shortness of breath, decrease in appetite, blood in the fluid coughed up from the lungs, persistent worsening cough, pain or restrictive feeling in the chest, inflammation of the neck or face, weight loss, fatigue or anemia.

## Effects

Mesothelioma is the form of cancer that is most commonly and nearly exclusively caused by exposure to high levels of asbestos. Mesothelioma is the occurrence of malignant cells in the mesothelium, or membranous sac that surrounds the majority of the human body's internal organs.   
  
Mesothelioma is usually found in the lining between the lungs and chest, but can also be found in the sac surrounding the heart or the abdominal cavity lining. Typically, mesothelioma is treated with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, but survival rates are very low between eight and nine percent, once the disease has been contracted.

## Effects

Lung cancer is a disease which results in the uncontrolled growth and development of cancerous cells or tumors on the lungs. There are two types of lung cancer: non small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer.  
  
While non small-cell lung cancer is typically treated with surgery, small cell lung cancer is typically treated with radiation and chemotherapy. The main source of lung cancer throughout the world is through the inhalation of tobacco smoke, but asbestos is also a significant contributor to the disease. Survival rates for lung cancer are currently around 14 percent when treated properly.

## Effects

Asbestosis is the inflammation and scarring of the lungs when asbestos particles become trapped inside the air cavity. The result of asbestosis is a significant build up of fibrous scar tissue, restricted breathing abilities, and a significant reduction in the lung's ability to absorb oxygen.   
  
Unfortunately, there is no treatment for asbestosis, but the symptoms themselves can be reduced through various physical therapies and enriched oxygen exposure. In many cases of asbestosis, patients also contract lung cancer or mesothelioma.

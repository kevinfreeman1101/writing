# About Gun Cleaning Supplies

One of the less desirable, but most essential, aspects of gun ownership and use is regular gun cleaning. Keeping guns continually clean is the only way to protect and maintain the gun's usefulness. But what supplies are needed to properly clean and maintain guns, and how are they used?

## History

Since the invention of the gun, it has been a well known fact that a gun that isn't regularly cleaned is a dangerous weapon to its own user. When guns first came about, ammunition was generally composed of lead balls, which heavily corroded gun barrels, and a much dirtier gunpowder than the refined powder in use today. As a result, guns had to be cleaned frequently, sometimes in the midst of a battle, in order to ensure their proper operation. Although modern guns and ammunition are much better built than their predecessors, regular cleaning is still essential, if not as frequent as past gun use called for.

## Significance

There are many gun cleaning supplies on the market today, each of them with a specific use in the process of gun cleaning. Basic materials that are used for gun cleaning include cloth patches, strong solvents, bore brushes and specialized gun oil. Selecting the proper supplies for each gun cleaning job, as well as using them in the proper order, is essential to preserving the gun and its usefulness. Improper use of these supplies can easily destroy a gun, rendering its parts useless or subject to rust and corrosion over time.

## Function

When cleaning a gun, strong solvents are first used inside the barrel and chamber to remove any powder, copper, or lead residue from the firing of the gun. These solvents should be applied using cloth patches and bore brushes, and never come in contact with the skin; protective gloves are a must. Next, new patches should be used to remove the solvent from all areas of the gun. Finally, more new patches will be needed to apply the gun oil to every metal surface, both inside and out. The gun oil will help protect the metal from the elements, and will also help dilute or remove the acidic oils left on the gun's many surfaces from human hands.

## Effects

When gun cleaning supplies are used properly, the fully cleaned gun will have all of its moving parts clean and well lubricated, and metal surfaces should be oiled enough to repel water, at least for short periods of exposure. In wet environments, all metal parts will need to be regularly oiled in order to maintain this level of water resistance. The surest method for ensuring that every part is properly maintained is to engage each part, checking for increased levels of friction or grating sounds that might indicate a need for further cleaning.

## Warning

While all moving gun parts and exposed metal should be well oiled when cleaning and maintaining a gun, it is equally important not to overuse gun oils, which may cause the gun to become slippery and difficult to handle. If too much oil is used, the gun's exterior should be thoroughly wiped down with a dry, absorbent cloth or towel so that only a thin layer of oil remains. This thin coat is all that is necessary to protect the gun, but will not cause the gun's surface to be overly slippery or hard to grip.

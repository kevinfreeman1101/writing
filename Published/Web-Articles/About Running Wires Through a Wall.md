# About Running Wires Through a Wall

Most homeowners go to great lengths to hide unsightly wires and bundles of wires running from the hordes of electronic devices staged throughout the home. When the wires simply can't be easily hidden, one option to consider is running wires through the wall for better aesthetics.

## Significance

When considering running wires through the wall, there are a few things to keep in mind. A number of tools will be needed for the job. The basic must-have list consists of a drill equipped with a long wood bit that will bore holes large enough for the wire bundle to pass through, a good utility knife for cutting through sheet rock, a wall patch kit complete with trowel, sheet rock tape, joint putty, drywall screws, and interior paint that matches the existing wall color. In cases where the wall cannot be removed in one piece, a new piece of sheet rock may also be needed.

## Function

Begin by carefully selecting the most convenient location for the wires to be run through the wall. The easiest and quickest way to run wires through walls--and to another location in the house--is to route them directly to the attic or crawlspace above the ceiling. When an appropriate location or route has been mapped out, the sheet rock must be carefully removed by using a utility knife to cut out the wall section where the wires will run. Ideally, this will be done in the open section between two vertical wall beams.

## Warning

If the sheet rock is removed only to reveal a solid concrete wall filling, another option will have to be considered. There are a few factors to consider in order to determine which option is the most viable. If there is another hollow wall that can be used without greatly affecting the intended purpose of the project, simply reroute the wires to this wall. In some cases, using a wireless system would create less hassle, and it can save on costs. If neither of these options seem suitable for the task, a building contractor may need to be consulted for any further decisions.

## Considerations

Assuming that the wall is hollow or contains only insulation, the project can continue. The next step will involve drilling holes through the horizontal wall studs in order to bring the wires through to the attic or crawlspace above the room. Use caution when performing this task! There may be working electrical lines routed through these same areas that must remain undisturbed. If the cables need to be routed past an electrical line, be sure that they do so at a 90 degree angle so that the electrical field near the existing wire doesn't interfere with the signal in the wires being routed.

## Expert Insight

After the holes have been drilled, the wires can be pulled through to the crawlspace or attic and routed to their intended destination. The final step in the process is to repair the sheet rock that was removed by either replacing the saved sheet rock or cutting a new piece that fits snugly in the section that was removed. Apply putty and sheet rock tape along the edges or joints of the new patch. Paint the newly patched wall to match the rest of the room. When the project is completed, all of the necessary wires will be out of sight, and the room will look as good as new.

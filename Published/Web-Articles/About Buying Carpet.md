# About Buying Carpet

Buying carpet is perhaps one of the most dreaded aspects of home building and maintenance. Most people simply don't know much about carpets, leaving them at the mercy of their salesperson when attempting to choose the right carpet for their needs. Thankfully, there are some basic tips that can help guide carpet buyers to make the right decisions.

## Significance

Making a carpet purchase is an important decision and, once the carpet is installed, one not easily reversed. This is why is pays to know the differences between carpet types and constructions before purchasing them. Relying on the advice of a carpet salesperson is not necessarily a bad idea, but obtaining a second opinion is also highly recommended.

## Function

One of the most important aspects of carpeting to consider is the carpet's twist. When carpet is closely inspected, the twist of each carpet thread can be easily seen, and the number of threads in each twist can be counted. A general rule of thumb is that the more twists there are in the thread of the carpet, the better the spring, or ability to spring back up after being flattened, and durability will be. Conversely, carpets with too much twist tend to be less vibrant and much more rigid than may be desired. It is important to find the right combination of twist and vibrancy that will suit the needs of each room in the home.

## Features

Most carpets also come with a pre-determined level of stain resistance. This is an important consideration because carpet that is not stain resistant will need to be professionally cleaned much more frequently than carpet that naturally repels soils and stains. Over time, frequent carpet cleaning becomes a serious cost issue that can easily justify the added expense that comes with the better stain resistant varieties.

## Considerations

Some carpets also come with a static guard that will help prevent the buildup of static fields in the carpet fibers. Static shocks are simply a pesky annoyance in most cases, but can also be quite painful when a strong static field has built up over time. As people walk over the charged carpet they absorb that charge, and when they touch items in the house with an opposite charge, such as a light switch, a quick burst of electricity results that equalizes the different polarities. This painful annoyance is certainly something to avoid when possible.

## Benefits

Making the proper carpet selection can enhance the feel of each room, giving the more elegant settings the desired ambiance while creating a more relaxed atmosphere in others. Typically, a smooth cut and high density carpet is more appropriate for formal settings, although it also shows traffic more easily. Conversely, an uneven cut and medium density shows less traffic, but creates a more relaxed, tailored look.

## Expert Insight

Before going into a carpet store to begin making a selection, it can be helpful to get some online price quotes from various retailers in order to have a basis for comparison. Some of the more reputable carpet retailers online to look at are listed in the resources section. Although local carpet retailers will vary, shopping the online retailers first can help to develop an idea of what kinds of carpet are desired and what the general costs should be.

# Tips For Moving a Kayak

While household moving can be a stressful and often daunting task, moving large items such as kayaks along with the household can be especially difficult for those who aren’t familiar with the steps that can be taken to make the process faster, smoother, and practically stress free. In fact, many moves can be made easier when kayaks are present, turning them from burden to a blessing. 

## Where to Put It

Because kayaks are so long and light, the best place to secure them during a move is along the left or right side walls of the moving van or trailer, secured sideways so that the kayak seat opening is facing the inside of the packing area, and placed as high as possible so that there is no clearance between the kayak and the ceiling. Typically, this will need to be done at the very beginning of the move, using moving straps or ropes to firmly secure it in place. Be sure that the straps used are strong enough to support a heavy load, as the kayak will probably be used later to store some of your belongings. 

## Utilizing Empty Space

One of the best benefits that kayaks have to offer during a move is their rigid structure that can protect fragile and hard to pack items. This means that once the kayak is secured, movers can load it with these items, using the extra space to its maximum potential and packing items that would otherwise need a great deal of time and consideration. As you fill the kayak, be sure that you don’t pack too many breakable items together, as they can still shift or become dislodged during transit and break. If a great number of breakables go into the kayak, stuff some extra padding around them so they are still protected. 

## Working Around It

As the moving van or trailer is loaded, each tier - or row of stacked items - should be packed tightly around the kayak to ensure that it has as much additional support as possible during transit. Typically, heavier items belong at the base of the tiers, while lighter items can be placed at the tops, but be sure to place only heavily padded or rigid items underneath and around the kayak that won’t break if it shifts during transit. Because the kayak will probably be loaded with a number of smaller household items, it will be heavy enough to need some special consideration as items are packed around it. 

## Packing to the Max

In the event that there are too many items to be moved to fit into the moving van or trailer, kayaks can also be used as extra moving spaces during transit. Simply secure the kayak to the top of a following vehicle, as though it were being transported for normal use, and fill it with the extra items that didn’t fit. Cover the kayak opening with a moving pad or blanket before tying it off so that the items can’t blow out during transit.

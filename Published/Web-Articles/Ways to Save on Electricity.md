# Ways to Save on Electricity

## Keep the Elements Out

One of the most efficient ways to save on heating and cooling costs in a home is to ensure that every window joint and door is properly sealed to prevent air from flowing into or out from the home. To enhance this effect, make sure that the walls in your home are properly insulated, and that all windows are designed for energy efficiency. 

Keeping your house sealed from the elements can not only provide tax benefits from buying materials, but can also save up to 20% on energy costs in the home. 

When checking your house for any sealing issues, remember to inspect the attic and air-duct systems, which can become leaky over time, resulting in a much higher bill at the end of the month.

## Only Use Recommended Appliances

Energy Star provides purchasing guidelines for most heating and cooling systems that help homeowners to determine which systems will work best for them. These guidelines are designed to maximize your energy dollars, as well as extend the life of the heating and cooling systems purchased. 

Though common thinking suggests that bigger systems will provide better results, the opposite is often the case, causing overly large – or overly small – systems to bog down under a larger workload as they work to produce results outside of their normal range.

## Use Energy Saving Devices

Though energy saving appliances are often more expensive, they provide a cost savings over time that can not only make up the difference in price, but also keep more money in homeowner’s pockets – where it belongs. 

Switching from incandescent lighting to compact fluorescent bulbs alone can reduce lighting costs by 75%, plus the bulbs last up to eight times longer than their predecessors. 

Using power saving washers and dryers can significantly reduce electric and water bills simultaneously, saving money and reducing consumption levels in the household.

Stay away from refrigerators with frozen food trays; these little amenities might be convenient, but they also take a great deal more energy to operate. 

If there is enough room in the home, consider purchasing a chest freezer instead of a combination fridge/freezer. Chest freezers operate much more efficiently than the freezer portion of combination devices while producing the exact same results; perfectly preserved frozen food.

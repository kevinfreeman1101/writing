# Who Discovered the Proton?

Making major scientific discoveries is one of the most prestigious and worthwhile pursuits of physicists and science enthusiasts around the world. The pursuit of new findings in atomic science has led to much of the technology that modern society now enjoys, including the discovery of the proton.

## History

The existence of the proton was first proved by Ernest Rutherford, First Baron Rutherford of Nelson, in 1918. Among his many scientific discoveries listed are the discoveries of the atomic nucleus, of alpha and beta radiation, and of the radioactive transformation of atoms. Because of his theories regarding the radioactive transformation of atoms, Rutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1908.

## Theories/Speculation

Working with various physicists, including Frederick Soddy, H. Geiger and E. Marsden, Ernest Rutherford gained a world-renowned reputation in the fields of atomic science and radioactivity. His theories were the basis for the still-accepted atomic theory proposed by Niels Bohr, in which atoms are composed of a heavy nucleus made of protons and/or neutrons with electrons in orbit.

## Geography

Ernest Rutherford was born in New Zealand in 1871. While living in New Zealand, Rutherford attained three degrees from the University of New Zealand, but was compelled to leave the country in 1895 when he was unable to attain employment there as a schoolteacher. He moved on to work at Cambridge University, McGill University and the University of Manchester, finally becoming the professor and director of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge in 1919.

## Time Frame

Ernest Rutherford lived from 1871-1937, making significant contributions to the field of physics during his lifetime. He was formally knighted in 1914, as well as raised to the peerage in 1931. Knighthood is a nonhereditary title obtained through service to country or personal merit. The rank of a knight is next below that of a baronet. The rank of peer, however, confers an equality with the five levels of English nobility. In 1933, four years before his death, he became the president of the Academic Assistance Council, whose goal was to provide assistance to Jewish scholars who had suffered under Nazi persecution.

## Expert Insight

C.P. Snow described Ernest Rutherford as being big, clumsy and having a "substantial bay window that started in the middle of his chest." Snow went on to say that Rutherford did not appear to be an intellectual, but did seem to have the physical attributes of one who has a "great weight of character and gifts." (encyclopedia.com) Rutherford's peers agreed that although he made an enormous contribution to the worlds of science and physics, he generally maintained the attitude that his contributions were greater than they were, with this attitude extending to his perception of himself. It should be noted, however, that these perceptions were recounted with a general fondness.

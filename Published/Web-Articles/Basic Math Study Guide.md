# Basic Math Study Guide

Although many students view math as dull or difficult to learn, it is commonly found that the proper study techniques for basic math can make a significant difference in both understanding and enthusiasm for learning. With the right approach, basic math can be made more approachable for reluctant students, if not exciting once its usefulness is revealed.

## Approach

If the standard approach at learning basic math isn’t working well, or another approach is desired, try learning through every day applications rather than on paper. For addition and subtraction methods, practice price checking at stores to search for those extra bargains that can save money and make math more applicable to real life situations. In the case of multiplication or division, the same principles can be applied, multiplied by trips to the store to determine an average cost savings over time, such as saving 10 cents per tuna can for a period of six months (10 x 6), and then find the average weekly savings from that number (Total / 24). With the right attitude and approach, a seemingly complicated task can quickly become more understandable and reachable to a more practical mind.

## Repetition

While novel approaches are always recommended, the fact remains that information needs to be practiced before it can be well remembered. Repeating the same tasks on paper or mentally throughout the day can provide additional support in preparation for test day, and can also be beneficial in performing daily tasks. Think of all of the tasks you perform on a daily basis that require the use of basic math, even if the solution is normally provided by a calculator or another person, and experiment with your own solutions to the problems. 

## Order

While basic math can seem daunting from one perspective, taking it one step at a time and performing those steps in order is essential to understanding how and why the math works. Be sure to work from the beginning of your understanding forward, taking special care to understand each new process or step before moving on to the next. One of the most common reasons for students to feel behind in their studies is because they skipped ahead after missing out on some important lessons, and suddenly feel lost and confused as a result. 

## Notes

Though most students will offer an audible groan when the subject of note taking is brought up, it is important to remember that most successful students keep some form of notes as they progress through basic math. Taking notes is helpful for committing information to long term memory, and it can also provide a helpful and more understandable road map for a quick refresher than a thick and sometimes intimidating textbook. Some students even go so far as to prepare a quick “cheat sheet” before tests, containing all of the essential information that may be tested, as an ethical preparation method in their studies – just be sure to leave the “cheat sheet” at home if the test is going to be closed book.

# Tartar Control

According to the Mayo Clinic, removing tartar from the teeth is essential for preventing gum and bone loss that would otherwise result in the loss of teeth and possible serious conditions. Some of these conditions include coronary artery disease, stroke, low birth weight in babies, poorly controlled diabetes and respiratory problems. While many home methods are available to prevent tartar, there are no effective home removal solutions; tartar treatments can only be obtained through a licensed dental professional.

Scaling and root planing are two effective methods that, when combined, remove tartar and plaque buildup down to the base of periodontal pockets in the gums, create a smooth surface that reduces or eliminates plaque bonding -- thereby allowing the gums to heal -- and eliminate periodontal pockets. Scaling is typically performed with either a small scaler or an ultrasonic cleaner, which is followed by planing with a tooth polishing tool and antibacterial polishing compound.

When serious cases of periodontitis are encountered, oral antibiotic treatments may be used in addition to scaling and planing treatments. Oral antibiotic treatments can be administered via antibiotic mouth rinses or by inserting threads and gels containing antibiotics into the periodontal pockets. After insertion, antibiotic threads and gels will dissolve over time, allowing the gums to heal properly, even in the presence of particularly stubborn periodontal bacteria.

Pocket reduction surgery, or flap surgery, is a process by which a dentist or periodontist cuts back the periodontal pockets to reveal tartar and plaque buildup down to the roots of the teeth. Once fully exposed, tartar and plaque is removed using standard scaling and planing techniques. Following this, bone or soft tissue grafts, guided tissue regeneration, and enamel matrix derivative application may be used to help strengthen the bone and tissues around the roots of the teeth, particularly in cases where major tissue and bone loss has occurred.

Even after plaque and tartar have been completely removed, proper tooth and gum care is the only method for effectively preventing the return of periodontal diseases such as tartar and plaque. Daily brushing, flossing, use of mouth rinses, and regular dental cleanings are strongly recommended by the American Dental Association as a part of an effective campaign against the buildup of tartar and plaque. Further solutions include changing soft toothbrushes every 3 to 4 months, using an electric toothbrush to facilitate better cleaning and considering an inter-dental cleaner, such as a dental pick or dental stick, to effectively clean between teeth.

# About Bike Computers

The bike computer, or cyclocomputer, is perhaps one of the greatest innovations in the cycling world since the invention of the bicycle itself. Modern day bike computers come equipped with a broad range of functions and features, and are essential for cyclists who need to track their progress and physical condition. Read on to learn more about the versatile capabilities of modern bike computers.

## History

Considering that the bicycle was invented in the early 19th century, bicycle computers are a very recent innovation. In their earliest stages, bicycle computers were used to calculate the speed of the bicycle, distance traveled, and most bike computers came with an optional timer for those cyclists looking to gain a real technological edge. Since the introduction of bike computers into the competitive cycling world, technology has advanced significantly to include the latest in advanced computing and recording features.

## Function

A typical bike computer gathers speed and distance information through a sensor mounted on or around the wheel. This sensor records and displays information based on wheel revolution calculations. This means that the person who installs the device must know the exact size of the wheel, and the computer will need to be reprogrammed if a different sized tire is installed in order to get the most accurate readings.

## Types

Standard bike computers still come with the traditional—and useful—features of speed, distance traveled, current time, and total mileage for those who wish to track the total miles on their bikes in addition to each trip distance. The more economic models, which cost between $20 and $30, are typically hard-wired from the computer to the wheel sensor, and cannot directly track information such as heart rate or altitude, but still display all of the basics and come with an LCD backlight for night viewing.

## Types

Medium grade bike computers are available for around $80 to $100, and provide a great deal more information to help cyclists improve their game. In addition to the standard information displays, these bike computers will typically come with optional wireless features, altimeters, and heart rate monitors. One of the more prominent capabilities of most medium grade bike computers is their ability to let cyclists know which training range they are in through the heart monitor and track each training cycle.

## Types

High end bike computers now come with myriads of handy features, but cyclists who desire these cutting edge tools can pay thousands of dollars to get them. From lightweight alloy-constructed, computerized wheel hubs with wireless transmission capabilities to Garmin GPS navigation systems, complete with turn by turn directions, these costly computers are an absolute must for cyclists who wish to intensely scrutinize and record their training sessions for later review. Many brands now feature wireless information sharing between similar computers as well, so that cyclists can prove to their peers that they beat a cycling record or accomplished a group goal.

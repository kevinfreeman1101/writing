# How Optics Reveal Our Universe

By Kevin Freeman

## Manipulation of Light

Optic lenses are clear, or transparent, substances that allow light to pass through them, but change the light’s density or angle of travel in the process. They are typically made from glass or plastic, but can be constructed from any material that is transparent enough to allow at least some light to pass through. Optic lenses are designed to accomplish one of three basic tasks: to change the direction of light (refraction), to change the density of light (magnification), or to change the light’s focus. 

## Changing Light’s Direction

One commonly used tool that changes the direction in which light travels is a projector. Projectors operate by changing the course of the light passing through a lens in order to project the image onto a desired surface from another location. A common example of this is a schoolroom projector that teachers use to display information for their students. By writing or printing the desired projection design on a clear sheet of plastic and then placing the sheet over the projector’s light table, the image is redirected through optic lenses inside the projector’s head and focused on a screen for everyone to see. 

In this same fashion, the light entering a telescope is redirected through the viewing lens and into the viewer’s eye to show a magnified picture of a part of our universe. The viewer’s eye is much like the screen that teachers use to display their lessons, allowing the brain to see and interpret the image that the light reveals. 

## Changing Light’s Density

Altering image size allows us to take a very tiny portion of our view into space and expand it into a larger picture for observation and analysis. This is accomplished by reducing the density of the light passing through the telescope’s lens by taking a tightly packed bundle of light particles, called photons, and spreading them out evenly to make the image they produce appear larger. Imagine looking through a telescope to see the surface of our moon. Rather than looking at the entire night sky, the telescope only looks at a small portion of it, but it expands that portion so that we can view more of the smaller details. 

## Changing Light’s Focus

One of the earliest uses for optic lenses was in focusing images by changing the direction of the light particles passing through them so that the particles converge, or come together to a single point, in a different place. Imagine that you are in a dark room and point the beam of a flashlight onto a picture on your wall. If you move the flashlight farther away from the picture, the light beam illuminates more of the wall around the picture, but if you move it closer, the illuminated area grows smaller until only the picture is illuminated. If you move the flashlight so that only the picture is illuminated, you are focusing the beam of light to fit the size of the picture.

A telescope uses optic lenses to focus the light passing through it into a perfectly sized image for the human eye to see. By looking into the viewing lens, much like moving the light closer to the picture, you place your eye at the perfect distance for the image to be projected onto the retina of your eye, where the brain can interpret the image for you. Likewise, if you move farther away from the lens, the image will quickly become distorted, or even disappear, as you move away from the focal point of the image.

# About Investment Trading Accounts

Signing up for an investment trading account can allow investors to have control over their investments in ways that were not possible when accounts were solely managed by professional traders and investment firms. But how do investment trading accounts work, and what advantages do they offer for investors? Read on to learn more about investment trading accounts.

## History

Investment trading accounts are a somewhat recent addition to the investment world, and are now gaining a large degree of popularity among individual investors. Beginning as a simple electronic method for buying and selling stock, personal investment trading accounts are now useful for creating retirement accounts and trading options, bonds and commodities in addition to stocks.

## Significance

Personal investment trading accounts offer individual investors the advantage that was once reserved only for well-connected traders who would often trade their personal investments in a much more timely manner than that of their clients when market conditions suggested that the trade was necessary. This meant that investors were prone to losing more of their money than should have been necessary because they were forced to use a third party in order to have the ability to invest. Now, with the use of personal investment trading accounts, investors can monitor and trade their own investments with the timeliness that they desire.

## Types

Most personal investment trading accounts can now be accessed through the Internet, and many of the investment firms that offer the accounts also offer professional advice and other financial services to their investors. Conversely, some accounts are very basic, offering only a medium for trading investments and little to no professional advice without incurring extra costs. The advantage of the more basic accounts is that they are usually provided at a much lower cost than that of their competitors, including lower fees for most trades, and even free trades in some cases.

## Considerations

An important consideration of investment trading accounts is the amount of financial research and statistical market analysis that is accessible through the account or the investment firm. This information is not to be confused with the advice of investment professionals, who may still have their own goals in mind when making recommendations. Some firms charge an extra fee for access to this "inside" information while others offer the extra options as standard account features. Because market analysis is integral to making wise investment decisions, most investors choose to either invest through accounts that provide access to market research and analysis or purchase the research and analysis through a trusted information source outside of the account's investment firm.

## Warning

Although investment trading accounts offer a number of advantages to investors that were not previously available, investors should always ensure that they are familiar with the workings of the market and the subsequent laws that govern it before investing their money into it. The investment markets can be extremely volatile at times, and most investments have no guarantees of profitability, or even of survivability. The best way to invest in any market is very cautiously, and only after researching the history of the market and every implication that the investment might have.

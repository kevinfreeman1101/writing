# About Car Engine Problems

Owning and operating a car has become an essential part of modern life. Unfortunately, car engines can frequently experience problems due to manufacturer defects or improper maintenance. There are a few things, however, that car owners can do to prevent and control car engine problems.

## Prevention/Solution

One of the most common mistakes that car owners make is not regularly checking all engine fluids and keeping them at their proper levels. It seems as though everyone is guilty of this little error, but if a regular maintenance log is kept on a vehicle, it not only boosts the selling value, but also makes buyers more comfortable in making the purchase when it comes time to trade up. Best of all, regular monitoring of engine fluids can also prevent major damage from occurring before it even begins.

## Effects

While there are a thousand things that could go wrong with a car engine at any time, there are also some major signs to watch for and have the car inspected as soon as they are noticed. Quick action can equate to significant savings on major repair bills later on down the road, not to mention the time and hassle of having a car towed when it is too late.

## Identification

A sulfurous smell emanating from under the hood usually means that there is a problem with the battery or alternator. The smell results from toxic battery acid as it leaks out into the engine compartment. A high-pitched squealing noise can mean that a belt is loose. Belts are quick and easy problems to fix unless they are allowed to operate untightened until they break. Thick smoke is an indication that motor oil is leaking directly onto an exhaust pipe; while this problem might not indicate serious engine damage, it does present a hazardous waste issue as well as a distraction to other drivers.

## Considerations

One of the handiest ways to be ready for car engine problems is to keep a light repair kit in the car's trunk at all times. Along with the typical screwdrivers, pliers, wrenches and sockets, be sure to include reflective triangles or road flares for alerting other motorists, a high visibility vest, toilet paper and a small medical kit. Depending on the area, it can also be extremely helpful to keep some warm blankets and a spare change of clothes in case the car becomes stuck during a severe winter storm.

## Expert Insight

One of the worst places to be stuck in a broken down car is in the snow, when help might not arrive for quite some time. In situations like this, it can save lives to keep a book of matches, bottle of rubbing alcohol, coffee can and roll of toilet paper for use as a heat source. If the roll of toilet paper is placed in the can and soaked in a moderate amount of rubbing alcohol, the paper acts as a wick that will result in a slow burning heater. If this is used, take great caution. Alcohol flames are barely visible, but can still cause serious burns if not treated carefully, and be sure to crack a window to prevent asphyxiation.

# About Free Stock Trading Accounts

In the past, stock trading required a great deal of market knowledge and training, as well as connections to individuals and markets that were often hard to obtain. Thankfully, modern technology has helped to provide much easier processes for trading stocks, including some that are completely free to their users.

## Significance

Free stock trading accounts are offered through investment companies such as Zecco or Etrade, as well as many others. These free accounts allow users to buy, sell and trade stocks and commodities without being forced to utilize a "middle man" service such as a professional stock trader. Although most stock transactions still have fees associated with them, firms like Zecco offer a number of free trades to users who meet their requirements.

## Types

Free stock trading accounts are generally used solely through the Internet, but there are many variations that users should be aware of before choosing an account type. Some trading accounts can be used for multiple purposes while others are directed toward the exclusive trading of stocks, options, retirement accounts or bonds. Users should fully understand each of these trading mediums and account types before investing to prevent unwanted penalties or mistakes from occurring.

## Considerations

One of the more recent and popular free stock trading accounts is offered by an investment firm called Zecco. The main draw for investors to use Zecco is the money savings that can be utilized through their trading accounts. Zecco offers a predetermined number of free trades per month for users who only have to maintain a minimum balance in their account to qualify. This means that any quantity of stocks can be traded in transactions up to the limited number, and the cost to the trader will be absolutely nothing.

## Features

One useful feature that free stock trading accounts offer is the ability to invest in specialized accounts for tax deferment or other tax benefits. Investors can open free accounts in order to invest in IRAs, 401ks and ESAs, to name only a few, and reap their tax benefits without having to pay an expensive investment firm to manage them. The resulting savings can also be invested to increase account balances, or investors can keep a larger portion of their own money for other uses.

## Warning

Although there are many attractive reasons to use free stock trading accounts for investments, it is always recommended that investors obtain the advice of an expert before putting their hard-earned money in the market. There is no guarantee that investments will not be lost, and some types of investments can actually incur a debt that is larger than the amount invested, which the investor will be responsible to pay. Libraries and the Internet are great resources for learning more about these processes, and investing should always be engaged in responsibly and with caution.

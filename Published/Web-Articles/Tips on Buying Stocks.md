# Tips on Buying Stocks

Investing money in the stock market is the quickest and easiest way to share in the profits--and losses--of any publicly traded company without becoming an entrepreneur. Knowing which companies are poised to bring you profit in the stock market and which companies are on the brink of failure is the absolute foundation of successful investing. Here are a few ways to ensure that the companies you pick are the ones that will make you money.

## Instructions

Difficulty:Â Moderately Challenging

## Step 1:  


Look at the company's balance sheet. Every publicly traded company must file their balance sheet regularly with the SEC, and most stock searching sites like Yahoo! and Google will display those balances in an easy-to-read format (see Resources below). The key to understanding a company's stability lies in their debt-to-income ratio. Typically, the heavier a company relies on debt to continue operations, the more that company is subject to failure during long periods of downturn or an internal crisis. Some companies even operate purely on cash, making their ability to withstand any storm far greater than their debt-ridden competition.

## Step 2:  


View the company's recent gains. Use free stock research sites like Yahoo! or Google to see if a company is on the rise, trading on a level horizon or enduring a decline (see Resources below). Typically, stocks will follow these trends for varying periods of time before reversing their course or stabilizing at a new level. Before deciding that a company is on the rise, be sure that their history doesn't indicate a high level of volatility, first rising up to new heights and then falling down to new lows for no apparent reason.

## Step 3:  


Check the percentage of institutional ownership. The level of institutional ownership in a company is often a good indicator of the professional opinions regarding that company. If a great deal of institutions are looking at a particular stock, or have announced their intentions to buy a great deal of shares, the chances are good that the company's stock price is about to see a new high. Investor confidence is never to be underestimated as a price raising--or lowering--tool.

## Step 4:  


Look at the analyst ratings. There are a multitude of free analyst ratings that are made available to the public through organizations and the Internet (see Resources below). While there are probably as many analysts that are sour on an average stock as there are analysts that recommend investing in it, a bit of careful research will reveal the accuracy of each analyst's predictions over time. There are usually some cases in which the vast majority of analysts can agree that a particular stock is a good investment. These cases should serve as indicators that the public sentiment is good, and the stock is truly worth considering as an investment.

## Step 5:  


Use chart analysis tools to your advantage. There are multitudes of stock chart analysis tools available that can help investors to know if a company is strong, if it is a good time to invest in it and what potential it may have for success. Learning to use these tools is essential to any good investment strategy, and can sometimes prevent serious losses. Most major drops in historical stock prices were preceded by a number of reliable indicators. Stay current on every chart analysis tool, and you will have a much greater chance of knowing what's coming (see Resources below).

## Tips & Warnings

- Investing in stocks does not guarantee profitability. Every investor places money in the stock market at his own risk, and the investment is subject to total loss in some situations. Be sure when you invest in the stock market that you understand the potential hazards and are prepared for any eventuality.

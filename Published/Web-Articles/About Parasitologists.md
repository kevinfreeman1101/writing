# About Parasitologists

Parasites are fascinating and sometimes deadly organisms that use free-living organisms as hosts. The host organism for a parasite provides the necessary environment to sustain it and often becomes sick or dies from the one-way relationship. Parasitologists study the relationship between parasite and host as well as the known processes for identifying and preventing parasitic infection. Their studies are vital to the cause of curing plants, animals and people of parasitic infection.

## History of

Since the earliest known existence of free-living organisms such as plants, animals and humans, dependent organisms known as parasites have outnumbered, invaded and continually plagued every free-living species in ways that are sometimes only irritating, but can be life threatening in other instances. Parasitologists have chosen to study parasites in hopes of gaining some insight into the prevention of parasitism and cures for infected hosts. Although parasitologist studies were largely unsuccessful in earlier times, modern parasitologists have a much wider array of tools and information at their disposal to increase their knowledge and effectiveness.

## The Facts

There are multitudes of known parasite species throughout the environment, ranging from microscopic in size to species that can grow to much larger dimensions. Because hosts and their parasite invaders are engaged in a constant and changing battle, the environment that parasitologists study is an equally adaptive one that requires constant treatment modifications to achieve successful results.

## The Facts

Since the creation of The American Society of Parasitologists in 1924, the immense diversity of parasite species has resulted in the creation of an equally diverse array of specializations for parasitologists. Some parasitologists study only plants in hopes of creating stronger and more plentiful crops through resistance to parasitism. Others are veterinary specialists, treating animals for parasitism. Still others focus on human parasitism and the multitudinous forms of infection and disease caused by parasitism.

## Risk Factors

Of the many varieties of parasitology, the most well-known role of parasitologists specializes in diagnosing and treating humans. Diseases such as malaria, which is transferred by parasites, and species such as hook worms, blood flukes and tapeworms are serious conditions that lead to sickness and death in most cases. Despite nearly a century of documentation and study in America alone, the number of unknown parasite species and the diseases caused by them is yet to be determined.

## Significance

Due to the rampant invasion of every free-living arena by parasites, the need for parasitologists continues to grow stronger as each species adapts and overcomes existing defenses. There are still no known cures for many parasite-spread diseases, and if parasite infection goes undetected for too long, it can become impossible to separate the host from the parasite without fatal results. Parasitologists have an immense task before them, but their studies have already yielded amazing results, and the future is likely to hold many more.

# Basement Furniture Moving Tips

If the moving process is well known for its stressfulness and level of difficulty, moving basements are even more renowned for the same reasons. Understanding the most efficient methods for moving the basement area, however, can save time, money, and stress by making the goal much more attainable.

## The Plan of Attack

In this war, there can only be one outcome; a basement that is completely devoid of all household goods. To accomplish this objective, use a systematic approach that helps keep you motivated throughout the process, transitioning logically from the beginning to the end. To begin, prepare all items for moving, including furniture disassembly, stacking boxes in areas where they are out of the way but still reachable, and protecting the area from damage, including floors, doorways, and low ceilings. Using a systematic approach, the basement can then be cleared by starting near the stairs and working outward so that each area is completely emptied before moving on to the next. 

## Furniture Disassembly

Most homeowners have at least a few furniture items within their homes that can be completely disassembled, making them much easier to move and less likely to break in the process. Although the disassembly and reassembly processes are often time consuming and laborious, it is always recommended that these items be broken down to their smallest parts for their protection, making the moving process somewhat less difficult by securing the parts in easy-to-move bundles. Be sure to document any steps that will be needed during reassembly, labeling parts and sections that might be confusing or need to be reassembled in a certain order. Also, remember to tape hardware packets to their designated parts using box tape so they don’t become lost or mixed up in the midst of the chaos. 

## Moving Boxes and Bundles

When boxes, small furniture items, and parts bundles are pre-stacked to your dolly’s carrying height before the move begins, each stack can be quickly grabbed and moved to make the process much more efficient. For those who prefer not to use a dolly to carry items up flights of stairs, a single appliance strap can be used to carry small stacks instead. Simply set the items onto the strap, cinch them tight using a loop on one end, and use the strap to carry the boxes on your back as you would a single-strapped backpack. This transfers the weight of the load onto your legs – as opposed to your back – and allows you to see where you are stepping as you walk. If an appliance strap is used, remember to use one hand to hold the strap while the other stabilizes the boxes, which may slide from side to side while walking.

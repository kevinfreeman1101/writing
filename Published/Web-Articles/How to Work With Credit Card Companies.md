# How to Work With Credit Card Companies

Working with credit card companies can be a frustrating and time consuming process. Problems range from spending hours on hold to finally speaking with representatives that usually don't understand or care about your problems, much less have the knowledge to do anything about them. Accomplishing your goal with them can often seem hopeless, but take heart because there are a few techniques that, when used in the right ways, will nearly always put you on the fast track to lower interest rates and payments.

## Instructions

Difficulty: Moderately Easy

### Things You'll Need:

- Speaker phone or hands-free phone   
Pen   
Paper

## Step 1:  


When you've got your hands-free phone set hooked up, pick up the phone and dial the number on the back of your credit card. You're going to sit on hold for a while, so have a book ready or something to occupy yourself through the duration. Credit card companies can have up to a 45-minute wait time before you can get through to a human voice. When a representative picks up the line, begin by explaining that you always get the name and employee number of each representative you speak with so you can later write a letter of commendation to his supervisor. If all goes well, this will not only set the representative up to be as helpful as possible, but will give you the information you need to try to back up any promises the representative makes.

## Step 2:  


Now it's time to accomplish the more difficult task; lowering your interest rate. Credit card companies know from their own marketing efforts that you've probably got a stack of competitive offers on your table already. If they are interested in keeping your business, chances are that they'll be willing to compete with them. This is the part that requires a cordial but firm tone to begin negotiation. If the representative claims she can do nothing for you, simply and kindly request to speak with her supervisor. Although the representative may not wish for you to do this, you have the right to speak with someone who has the authority to make changes to your account. Let the representative know that you understand your rights and don't give in until you are speaking with someone who can get the job done. When you've got the supervisor on the phone, make sure to get her name and employee number as well.

## Step 3:  


This is the part where its okay to sound a little frustrated. If the representative believes that you are a pushover, he will probably not give in to the requests you are making. Let the representative know in no uncertain terms that you are about 30 seconds away from transferring your balance to a competitor card with a much lower rate and no annual fees. Nine times out of 10, this will be enough to get your rate lowered and your monthly payments decreased. If you happen to run into that 10th option and the company refuses to give in, kindly thank the representative for his time, inform him that you will still be sending a letter to the company's higher level employees regarding your situation, and hang up. If you've got the time to wait on hold again, call back and repeat the process. You will almost certainly get a different representative and a different supervisor with your next call, and this time the representative may be more open to negotiation than the last. If this is not the case, make a daily hobby out of calling and bugging every representative you can speak with, and you will eventually find one that is willing to make a deal. The keys to this process are patience and perseverance. Just keep in mind that you are doing this to save yourself a ton of money in the long run.

## Step 4:  


When you've finally got your interest rate and fees lowered, make a point of actually writing that letter of commendation, being sure to include the names and employee numbers of the representatives who finally helped you accomplish your goal. Let the company know that these representatives are probably the only reason you decided to keep your balance where it is. At the very least, you will have done the company a great service by pointing out some people that they will want to keep around. Plus, it's always possible that your letter will spark enough interest for an even better offer to be sent your way.


## Tips & Warnings

- In the unlikely event that this process is unsuccessful in accomplishing your goals, you may need to transfer your balance to a competitor and try again. Don't worry about your low credit score or a missed payment history; even the large companies only check about 1/3 of their credit applications; they blindly approve the remaining 2/3! Even if you end up transferring to a card with an equally bad interest rate and/or fees, 90 percent of credit card companies are willing to negotiate with you once you are their customer.

# About Proper Sword Care & Sharpening

Owning a sword brings about a sense of connection with the past in the hearts of many sword collectors. Whether the sword is a replica or has historical significance, proper sword care and sharpening is essential to preserving the sword and protecting it against possible damage. Read on to learn more about proper sword care and sharpening.

## History

For thousands of years, the sword was the standard personal defense and attack weapon of choice for many types of warriors. Nations rose and fell by the sword and, through the ages, a number of sword shapes and styles were developed. Despite these variations in shape and style, the sword had to be constantly cared for and protected from the elements in order to preserve its usefulness.

## Function

There are two important reasons for the continual implementation of proper sword care and sharpening: preventing sword cracking or breakage and keeping moisture from causing rust to corrode the blade. While protection from the elements is a more commonly understood necessity, many sword collectors are unaware that the slightest nick in the edge of a blade can weaken the entire sword to the point of breaking through its use.

## Types

The methods for proper sword care and sharpening are simple, but can be time consuming. First, the blade will need to be cleaned and lightly coated with a thick oil; rem oil works well for this purpose, but some collectors prefer to first use a spray lubricant such as WD-40 first in order to break loose any dirt or debris. Next, a file should be used to smooth out any nicks in the blade, and then the edge can be restored using a flat whetstone and a great care for the angle at which it is used.

## Considerations

Most sword collectors prefer to use a series of varying-grade whetstones when restoring an edge. By beginning with a rougher stone and progressing to a finer grade, the smoothness of the metal will help to ensure that no debris gets caught on any rough surfaces during the sword's use. Many blade smiths prefer to purchase a small stone, about 6 inches in length, and glue it onto a wooden handle for easier and safer work.

## Considerations

When working with sharpened blades, it is essential to place safety first. Many hardware stores sell Kevlar gloves that should be worn to help prevent injury, and their cost is usually minimal. It can also be helpful to wrap a towel securely around the blade to act as a gripping point while working with the sharpened edge. Using the towel will help to further prevent injury, and will also protect the blade from any scratches through inadvertent contact with hard surfaces while sharpening.

# About Asbestos Removal

There are many considerations to keep in mind when removing asbestos from a home or workplace. The most important of these is: how can I remove asbestos safely? The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set forth a rigid set of guidelines that are designed to prevent exposure to the harmful fibers. Read below to learn more.

## Significance

Because of the life-threatening nature associated with high levels of asbestos exposure, the EPA often recommends that if a house contains asbestos in the ceiling insulation or paint, the best solution is to leave the material undisturbed.   
  
Asbestos fibers are very small, making a human hair seem large in comparison. When disturbed, the fibers quickly become airborne and can be inhaled by any occupants in the home. This is why the EPA recommends that, as long as the asbestos is located in a place where it will lie undisturbed, it should be left exactly where it is.

## Considerations

When it is determined that asbestos does need to be removed from a building, a company that specializes in asbestos removal should always be used rather than personally attempting the hazardous procedure. Although it is legal for homeowners to personally remove the material, strict adherence to the EPA's National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) must be followed.

## Warning

High concentrations of asbestos exposure often result in diseases such as mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis. All of these diseases are deadly, and prognosis for those who have contracted them is grim.   
  
When asbestos is inhaled into the lungs, it tends to become trapped there, resulting in a natural immune response that then results in the release of carcinogens (cancer-causing elements) into the bloodstream over a period of 10 to 40 years. The asbestos itself can remain in the body permanently without dissolving.

## Function

The standard procedure for removing asbestos from any building is to completely seal off the area where the asbestos is located so that no contaminated air can escape. Any workers in the area will be required to wear high grade breathing apparatuses to prevent inhalation of the particles and the workers must be decontaminated before leaving the area.   
  
Decontamination includes removal and disposal of the worker's exposed clothes and work gear, while exposed skin should be thoroughly washed. Asbestos is best removed by first applying moisture so that particles become too heavy to become airborne.

## Function

Once the asbestos has been completely removed from the contaminated building, it must then be sealed off and safely disposed of. Common disposal methods include burying the material as a hazardous material in landfills, but the safest and most secure way to dispose of asbestos is through thermal decomposition. Thermal decomposition is a process in which the asbestos is heated to more than 1000 degrees Celsius, at which point it becomes a harmless silicate. If the material is heated further, the silicate then becomes a silicate glass which can be used to make nonhazardous materials like floor tiles and bricks.

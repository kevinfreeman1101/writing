# How Do Roto Rooters Work?

## Plumbing Problems

Once a plumbing system is installed under the ground and inside the walls of the house, it is generally forgotten until a problem occurs. These problems are usually a result of long-term buildups or obstructions that prevent the flow of water or waste through the pipes as intended. While most plumbing systems are designed with future problems in mind, locating and fixing plumbing problems can be a costly and time-consuming endeavor in the best of situations. 

One of the more typical plumbing obstructions to occur are grease buildups, in which coagulated grease sticks to the inner walls of plumbing pipes and, over time, prevents more than a small trickle from passing through the pipes. Another common problem is tree roots, which can grow into a pipe over time and expand, rupturing the system or completely obstructing it. Finally, large debris can sometimes enter a plumbing system through toilets or sink drains, where it becomes lodged somewhere in the system and acts as a catcher for other kinds of debris until a tough clog has been formed. 

## Plumbing Solutions

Roto Rooter plumbing systems are simple, yet effective, innovations that combine the use of a cylindrical steel cutting tool, shaped and sized to fit the inner walls of water or sewer pipes, with a strong, but flexible, cable that can bend around corners and rotate in order to actuate the blade. Simply put, the Roto Rooter system inserts the cylindrical cutting blade into a slow draining or clogged pipe, and spins the blade as it moves deeper into the pipe so that the inner pipe walls are scoured clean and the obstruction is broken down to a manageable size that can exit the closed plumbing system. 

Roto Rooter now offers an alternative method for clearing blockages with a water jetting tool that replaces the spinning blade with highly concentrated jets of water in order to break down and clear blockages and obstructions. The water jets are powerful enough to clear plumbing systems, but will not typically scour the inner walls of pipes, which can, in the case of very old plumbing systems, rupture the pipe wall, creating the need for costly repairs. 

## History of Roto Rooter

Samuel Oscar Blanc invented the Roto Rooter system in the late 1920’s as an alternative to digging up and disassembling clogged pipes, which was often extremely costly and time consuming. His idea took shape as he brought together a washing machine motor, a 3/8” cable, and a set of roller skate wheels in order to unclog his son’s troublesome apartment drain.

What resulted was an apparatus that efficiently removed the clog, and inspired Samuel Oscar Blanc to build more of the machines for sale to other homeowners. Over time, Roto Rooters became a smash hit, and franchises began popping up across the nation. The Roto Rooter name was established as a reliable plumbing repair tool, and remains one of the most effective solutions available to this day.

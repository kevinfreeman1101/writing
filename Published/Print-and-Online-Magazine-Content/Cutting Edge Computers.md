Whether you own a laptop computer, netbook, or full-sized desktop with all the bells and whistles, it's a fairly good bet that in the moment after you made your purchase, the top-of-the-line, high-dollar machine you purchased wasn’t even put back on the shelf because this week’s upgrade replaced it as you walked out the door, causing your sizzling fast processor to instantly bog down from sheer terror. But don't give up just yet; the truth is that you don't have to be a computer guru to bring your machine right back to the cutting edge of speed and power.

In the constantly changing computer market, new technology costs are simply too high for average consumers to keep up with, and upgrading older computers can seem like a daunting task for all but the geekiest of techies. If you do decide to upgrade your system, however, not only can you get a much better computer for a far lower cost, but there are a number of free resources available on the web that assist technological newbies in selecting the right upgrade parts for their systems, plus they'll show every step in the installation process along the way.

The first step toward executing any successful upgrade is to figure out which parts you need, and why you need them. To do this, many technologically savvy consumers recommend using the free scanning software at Crucial.com. This easy to use, automated scanning system figures out what parts you have, gives a list of upgrade options, and allows you to buy them online if you like their prices. Before making any big decisions, though, surf around with the valuable information you obtain here, since better deals can often be found through reputable dealers with nothing more than a bit of patience and a good search engine.

If you are among the growing numbers of Mac owners looking for a boost, try browsing through the selection at Otherworldcomputing.com; here you can find an extensive list of upgrades, descriptions of the enhancements they will add to your Mac, MacBook, or Ibook, and purchase them on the spot. It is a common misconception that Mac’s can’t be upgraded, so if you own one, be sure to log in and check out the latest aftermarket options for your system in addition to a great selection of Mac-specific software.  

When the new parts arrive, they will need to be installed without causing any sparks, cracks, dings, or total system failures. Again, the tech-savvy will have the advantage here, understanding what needs to be done with an almost frustrating level of natural ease. But the rest of us aren’t far behind them with our newfound access to helpful how-to videos on sites like Geek.com or YouTube. If this idea still causes the traditional side of your brain to reel in terror, or if you're having difficulty locating a reputable source of information, there are also a growing number of celebrity techies ready to assist you through radio programs like the Kim Komando Show, complete with websites that update daily with the information they covered in their programs.  

Upgrading your computer won't prevent you from having to occasionally buy a whole new system; old technology can only be stretched so far, after all. But if your computer is bogging down, freezing up, or lavishly showering you with confusing error messages and exception codes (does anybody know what those jumbled numbers are supposed to be telling us?) don’t kick that rapidly depreciating asset to the curb just yet! Check out the software and hardware solutions that can clean up, transform, and accelerate your old system back into the modern era for what often adds up to about 25-50% of the price for a brand new system.

It’s Time to Check the Male

By Kevin Freeman

As Father’s Day rapidly approaches, many of us ponder the ways we would like to show our appreciation to those important men in our lives with new ties, hats, and related gifts. While traditional gift-giving is a wonderful tradition to observe, another more unique gift to consider is to contribute to the health and wellness of those important men in a more lasting way. 

This year, it may be no coincidence that Father’s Day (June 20th) lands in National Men’s Health Week (June 14th–20th). To add to the inspiration, June 19th is Prostate Cancer Awareness Day. Just a thought, but what if everyone chose to set an hour aside to spend walking and talking with the fathers and father figures in their lives about their health? How many lives might be changed, or even saved, from such a simple idea?

According to the Prostate Cancer Foundation, a staggering 1 in 6 men will eventually be diagnosed with prostate cancer. But there are many things that all of us can do to help our loved ones beat those odds. While prostate cancer can strike anyone at any time, a healthy combination of prevention and early detection can quickly turn devastating news into a very strong likelihood for survival. 

A healthy diet and frequent exercise can work wonders in preventing not only prostate cancer, but a virtual host of ailments that are much more likely to develop if preventative care isn’t taken. Rather than taking it on alone, why not join the effort for better health by challenging someone you know to walk with you, or share smarter meals for smaller waistlines? Studies have shown that reducing obesity levels not only lowers the odds of having prostate cancer, but it may also allow much earlier detection, which is an important key to winning the battle. 

Because early detection is so vital in beating any form of cancer, regular screenings are also an absolute must. The American Cancer Society recommends that men begin to have annual PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) and DRE (Digital Rectal Exam) screenings between ages 40–45, depending on specific risk levels, to significantly increase their odds for early detection. 

The good news is that medical science has advanced to a point at which we have a number of options available for treating prostate cancer. Thanks to a new gene-analysis test called Fluorescence in Situ-Hybridization (FISH) developed by researchers at Queens University, there may also be some very accurate ways to help choose the most effective prostate cancer treatment in the near future. 

By caring for ourselves and the loved ones in our lives, we can take control of our futures and promote happy, healthy lives for many years to come. Help HealthCareerWeb.com spread the vitality in everyone’s lives by taking an active approach to meet and overcome difficult challenges like prostate cancer and spread awareness about the risks that many of us will face.

# Healthcare Trends: Looking Back At 2011

Kevin Freeman

With HIPAA and HITECH dominating healthcare trends in 2011 – with no end in sight for 2012 – you can bet that technology is the main focus of this coverage. Electronic medical record conversions are at an all time high as hospitals and medical care providers scramble to qualify for federal funds before their legal deadlines. Healthcare mobile apps have brought new looks and functionality to the face of medical care as doctors gain quick access to astounding resources that help them make appropriate diagnoses, prescribe the right meds, and display detailed information to their patients. 

The Department of Health and Human Services believes that 80 percent of public hospitals and more than 40 percent of private hospitals plan to take advantage of federal incentives by converting to electronic medical record systems (EMR); about a third of existing Primary Care Providers have already made a commitment to convert their paper systems. 

Thanks to the wave of technology sweeping through America's healthcare system, record numbers of patients now handle most of their interactions with doctors online, including scheduling appointments, getting medical advice, refilling prescriptions, and even becoming more health conscious with online tools and information provided by medical organizations like Kaiser. As doctors gain the ability to communicate with patients online regarding minor medical issues, they are subsequently able to spend more time with serious cases, in addition to possibly taking on a few more patients. 

To add to this trend, a new $600,000 grant program is already underway to help disabled patients gain easier access to their electronic records. The US Department of Education has provided this grant to the National Center for Accessible Media to study the functionality of adaptive technology to assist people with visual and physical disabilities as they use web based systems to perform all of the same functions that electronic medical systems are providing to the general public. 

Between iPads and smartphones, doctors also gained access to an astounding number of specialized apps in 2011, many of which were designed specifically with doctors in mind. The available apps became so diverse, in fact, that doctors began to need apps and references to sort through the virtual ocean of possibilities to find the most reputable and useful for their respective specialties. 

Apps range from WebMD's extensive reference system, including everything from physiology to prescription interactions, and even procedure references in case doctors need a quick refresher. DocBookMD is a new networking and collaboration environment where doctors can consult with each other and learn about the latest medical trends from the people who are driving them. An intriguing iPad app called HeartPro allows users to rotate, view, and slice open any area of a virtual human heart, revealing the inner workings and an extensive map labeling each part and function – HeartPro has reached number one status in 40 countries now, with no signs of slowing down any time soon.   

With all of this wonderful technology, of course, comes a number of great dangers and controversies. Data breaches saw a massive surge in 2011, with 92 percent of all healthcare agencies reporting a breach of some kind in their systems. As organizations join the EMR community, they are also mandated to report any such data breaches, which has required the creation of a new auditing agency that will monitor the reporting process and ensure that healthcare organizations are proactively contacting their affected patients. 

The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has issued an SMS texting ban for physicians to prevent the sending of private medical information via text messages to patient's cellphones. While SMS messaging is a highly insecure way of sending private medical information – thus making it a possible violation of HIPAA – highly secure medical apps have already arisen to take their place as a safe and authorized means of communication between doctors and patients. 

Some of the most impressive strides that were taken in 2011 involved amazing breakthroughs in medical technology and the fight against communicable disease. In a recent article, we covered a very promising genetic modification of human T cells that cured 2 out of 3 patients of advanced leukemia; the first man-made blood vessels and muscle tissue were brought to light; new implants were designed to continually monitor tumors; and the list goes on. 

While 2011 seemed to be a beacon of hope for many doctors and patients alike, with technologies and procedural innovations bringing medicine to record heights of success, 2012 is shaping up to continue the trend. It boggles the mind to consider what we can truly do when we utilize our ever-growing resources and decide to change history. Here's to another great year!

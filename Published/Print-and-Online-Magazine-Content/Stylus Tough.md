Stylus Tough-8000: Tough with a Capital T

By Kevin Freeman

Fresh off the presses, there is a new camera in town that meets the objective of being tougher than anyone else’s while maintaining the high level image resolution and amazing features that are expected from a top of the line digital camera. The Olympus Stylus Tough-8000 is designed to be taken anywhere from snorkeling to ice climbing without missing a beat, capturing 12 million-pixel images that look clear and crisp even when stretched onto poster sized prints. The camera not only withstands freezing temperatures and deep water, but the impact resistant design keeps rugged vacationers snapping and sharing without having to worry about breakage.

Have you ever lost your favorite electronic device by doing nothing more than opening your cab door, and then watching as it hurtles down to the pavement to shatter into a million super-expensive pieces? If so, you aren’t alone, which is why the Tough is built to be rugged enough for any trucker, constructed with a solid metal that can withstand 220 foot-pounds of pressure, keeping its inner parts secure after drops from up to 6.6 feet. 

Even the zoom lens is located inside the camera’s body, just in case clumsy nature lovers decide to put the impact claims to the test while getting a close-up of an angry grizzly bear. Still not impressed? Try the image stabilization features to obtain perfectly clear angry grizzly photos while sprinting away, praying for a distraction or a chance fall into a bear-proof steel bunker. 

And how many times have you found yourself walking serenely along a boat dock, snapping a few scenic shots, when you suddenly plunge into icy cold water with the camera in tow. Though it’s possible that this only happens to article writing truck drivers out for a walk – yes, the water *was* cold – you might still wish to know that the Tough withstands watery depths of up to 33 feet, taking picture perfect liquid shots without hesitation. It also features a novel “tap control” technology, allowing cold water divers to capture, modify, and perfect their images by tapping the top, sides, or back of the camera without having to remove their neoprene gloves.  

Panoramic pictures are also no problem for the Tough, allowing users to slowly pan across three picture widths, splicing them together into one unforgettable scene. With the Olympus Master Software, Tough’s splicing capability stretches out to 10 frames, just in case everything in sight needs to be crammed into a single image for later boasts and brags. 

Shutter speeds are also desirably fast, averaging about 0.5 seconds at normal settings, and speeding up to a whopping 1/2000 of a second for extra quick continuous shooting. There are more than 24 shooting modes to select from, and users can preview various light and texture settings before saving their memories, showing the modified images in a split-screen, side-by-side comparison. 

So what’s the downside? The only drag to this beauty may lie in the price tag, listing at around $380 (prices may vary) before purchasing any accessories. But for a built-to-last camera that can be taken virtually anywhere, and seems to be engineered with the clumsiest, shakiest, most perfectionist truck drivers/deep sea divers/ice climbers on the face of the planet in mind, this may still be one of the safest investments our economy has to offer.

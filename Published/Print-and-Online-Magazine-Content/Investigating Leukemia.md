Investigating Leukemia

By Kevin Freeman

For any disease, early detection is key to beating the odds and becoming a survivor. But what if a deadly disease appears to be a common flu virus, or has even milder symptoms like excessive sweating at night? Such is often the case with leukemia – the most common form of cancer found in children, and a form of cancer frequently found in adults.

How Leukemia Affects the Body

There are 4 common forms of leukemia: acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Of these, the most commonly found types are acute lymphocytic leukemia in children, and acute myeloid leukemia in adults. 

All types of Leukemia begin in the bone marrow, where blood cell production occurs. Cancerous mutations in white blood cells disable the body’s natural infection defenses, resulting in sickness and death. These cells can also spread to the body’s organs, which is one of the reasons that leukemia is so difficult to treat. 

In acute forms of leukemia, mutated cells are immature and completely unable to function normally; in chronic forms of leukemia, white blood cells are more mature, and have limited function, but are still unable to perform their basic functions.

Once leukemia cells develop, they multiply at a fast rate and live longer than their healthy counterparts. This results in functional cells getting crowded out and replaced by dysfunctional cells. 

Assessing the Risk of Leukemia

Exposure to tobacco smoke is a widely known cause of leukemia. Because the chemicals in tobacco smoke enter the bloodstream through the lungs, they can end up residing in the bone marrow, where they corrupt healthy tissues, causing them to produce leukemic cells in the blood.

Chemicals like benzene have been linked to leukemia. Benzene is a petroleum derivative that is used to make household cleaners, drugs, gasoline, plastics, dyes, nylons, and other many other materials. 

Although studies have been inconclusive regarding exposure to x-rays or CT scans, high radiation levels are known to cause leukemia – this became evident when survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki resulted in much higher rates of leukemia for those within the radiation zone than for those in surrounding areas.

In the first year of life, having a twin with leukemia is a significant risk factor. This is believed to be a result of the transfer of white blood cells between fetuses in utero.

Other conditions that have been linked to leukemia include blood problems resulting in high levels of red blood cells, Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, Ataxia-telangiectasia, and Blackfan-Diamond syndrome. 

White males also have a higher rate of being diagnosed with leukemia, although the reasons for this are still unclear.

 

Early Detection

Because leukemia shares many of its symptoms with other common illnesses, see a doctor quickly if a more serious condition is suspected. Leukemia symptoms include fever; chills; weakness/fatigue; frequent infections; lack of appetite; weight loss without trying; swollen/tender lymph nodes, liver, or spleen; easy bleeding/bruising; tiny red spots under the skin; swollen/bleeding gums; excessive sweating, especially at night; bone/joint pain; anemia. 

When doctors suspect leukemia, they may perform a number of tests to obtain confirmation. Tests include examining your medical history; conducting a physical examination; blood tests; imaging tests, including x-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, MRI’s, and bone scans; biopsy of bone marrow; surgical biopsy of the lymph nodes; lumbar puncture. 

Treatment Options

Treatment options for leukemia include:

Radiation Therapy – intentional exposure to radiation

Biological therapy – teaching the body to recognize and naturally eliminate mutated white blood cells

Targeted therapy – introducing drugs that inhibit protein production for cells specific to the spread of leukemia

Stem Cell Transplant – after chemotherapy destroys blood stem cells, a transplant replenishes the body’s supply with healthy blood stem cells. Blood stem cells are the most basic form of blood cells before they become white or red blood cells and platelets.

Bone Marrow Transplant – replacing destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone marrow or stem cells. This has become a less common practice in lieu of peripheral blood stem cell transplants.

Outlook

Advances in medical science are showing very promising possibilities for the elimination of most forms of leukemia. Unfortunately, there are never enough funding sources or volunteers to fully explore all of these possibilities and find an effective cure.

Organ Transplants: Generating New Life from Wasted Tissue

By Kevin Freeman

In Hollywood, regenerating and replacing human organs for vitally injured main characters only requires a good (or sometimes only marginal) imagination. Like many new advancements in real science, however, doctors may be trying to catch up to science fiction with some very interesting ideas. The technique that Massachusetts General Hospital researchers are currently using, for example, may become a viable solution for human heart, lung, and liver transplantation in as little as five years – and the research team involved maintains that their success is all but guaranteed. 

With current technology, it is a fairly simple process to obtain healthy organ tissue that would function perfectly if only it could be properly infused with blood. The problem was that researchers couldn’t replicate the extremely intricate scaffolding that allows the circulatory system to deliver nutrients to all of the cells in the new organ. 

Korkut Uygun, a leading researcher at the Center for Engineering in Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital, believes that the problems involved in obtaining the scaffolding for a healthy organ to thrive can be solved using discarded, or even unhealthy, organs as a foundation. Interestingly enough, the organ’s condition doesn’t matter nearly as much as the parts that will be salvaged in the process.

First, the old organ must be placed into a sac where it is exposed to a flow of chemical detergents that are designed to strip the organ’s cells away while leaving the underlying structures in place. Once the cells are gone, what is left is a transparent mass that retains the shape and structure of the original organ – this is what researchers call the “scaffolding” that they so desperately need. 

In phase two, a nutrient rich fluid begins flowing through the existing vascular system of the organ scaffolding in order to prepare it for revitalization. Then, a flood of new, healthy organ cells are introduced, which rapidly occupy the positions of their discarded counterparts, allowing the organ to once again attain full functionality.

In phase three, the newly reconditioned organs are placed into living hosts – in this case, lab rats – where they begin to function as though they had grown themselves into place through natural processes. The one side effect that limits the entire operation, however, is that the blood vessels that were reused still aren’t as widespread as they need to be, which means that a great deal of tissue doesn’t receive proper blood flow, and will soon die.

At present, regenerated organs such as these can last for 10 days in culture, and have continued to function for more than 8 hours inside new hosts before they begin to show signs of failing. But Uygun believes that he already has a solution for that little problem – one that he hopes would lead to successful transplants in lab rats in as little as two years – which might then become a viable organ solution for humans as little as three years later.

What’s the big secret? That information is, of course, not being released to the public at this time, but if all goes as planned, the results might provide new hope for uncountable numbers of hopeful organ recipients in the very near future.

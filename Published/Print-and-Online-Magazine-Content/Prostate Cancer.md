It’s Time to Check the Male

By Kevin Freeman

Let’s face it: Fathers are absolutely essential for life as we know it to exist. Not only do fathers worldwide take on 50% of all efforts to increase our population, but many fathers also pass on essential skills to their children, such as kid-wrestling, spitting for distance, and the “smell test” for determining optimal laundry levels. Keeping these extremely important stereotypes (and many of the more important roles) in mind as Fathers Day rapidly approaches, it may also be a good time to read about a few of the ways in which we can show our appreciation for the fathers in our lives by spreading some awareness. 

June 19th – the day before Father’s Day – also marks an important day for keeping fathers and men everywhere in healthy condition: Prostate Cancer Awareness Day. 

According to the Prostate Cancer Foundation, an astounding 1 in 6 men will eventually be diagnosed with prostate cancer, but there are many things that all of us can do to help those who develop the condition beat the odds. While prostate cancer can strike anyone at any time, a healthy combination of prevention and early detection can quickly turn devastating news into a very strong likelihood for survival. 

A healthy diet and frequent exercise can work wonders in preventing not only prostate cancer, but a virtual host of ailments that are much more likely to develop if such care isn’t taken. Rather than using encouragement or taking it on alone, why not join in the effort for better health by challenging someone you know to start walking with you or planning out smarter meals for smaller waistlines? Studies have shown that reducing obesity levels not only lowers the odds of having prostate cancer, but it may also allow much earlier detection, which is an important key to winning the battle. 

Because early detection is so vital in beating any form of cancer, regular screenings are also an absolute must. The American Cancer Society recommends that men begin to have annual PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) and DRE (Digital Rectal Exam) screenings between ages 40 – 45, depending on specific risk levels, to significantly increase their odds for early detection. 

The good news is that medical science has advanced to a point at which there are many options available for treating prostate cancer. Thanks to a new gene-analysis test called Fluorescence in Situ-Hybridization (FISH) developed by researchers at Queens University, there may also be some very accurate ways to help choose the most effective treatment option in the near future. 

By caring for ourselves and the loved ones in our lives, we can take control of our futures and promote happy, healthy lives for many years to come. Help HealthCareerWeb.com spread the vitality in everyone’s lives by making sure we take an active approach to meet and overcome difficult challenges like prostate cancer and spread awareness about the risks that many of us will face.

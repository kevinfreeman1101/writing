Sleep Apnea and Heart Disease: A Disturbing Revelation

By Kevin Freeman

In a collaborative study that was recently published in the American Heart Association’s publication, Circulation ([http://circ.ahajournals.org/](http://circ.ahajournals.org/)), medical researchers found a strong link between Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and congenital heart disease and failure. The link was found in men between the ages of 40 and 70 whose apnea-and-hypopnea scores (AHI) were between 5 and 30 (measuring the number of times breathing stops or becomes restricted for more than 10 seconds in a given hour). These men showed a 68% increased risk for congenital heart disease and a 58% increased risk for congenital heart failure. Interestingly, women of all ages and older men showed no relative increase in risk from having OSA. 

The collaborative studies lasted for a span of more than 8 years on average, and covered a wide spectrum of candidates who were carefully chosen by ruling out many other significant factors that placed them in higher risk categories for having heart disease. The participants included 1,927 men and 2,495 women living in numerous areas around the United States. 

Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a condition that affects an estimated 9% of adult women and 24% of adult men. When sleeping, the airways of OSA patients become severely narrowed or closed, lowering the amount of oxygen in the blood and the body’s tissues by 3-4%, causing frequent neurological arousal (partially or completely waking up) during sleep, and may lead to numerous health conditions and ailments mainly involving the cardiovascular system. Among the stronger risk factors for being diagnosed with OSA are increased body weight, smoking, and diabetes. 

Although treatment for OSA varies, the most common method used to counter the malady is a machine called a CPAP, which delivers Continuous Positive Airway Pressure while patients sleep. CPAP machines quietly deliver light air pressure to the breathing passages to keep them open during sleep. This allows a significantly higher level of oxygen to enrich the blood, often greatly lowers fatigue levels, and significantly lowers risk for heart related health issues. Although many patients expect discomfort or inconvenience from using a CPAP machine, most report experiencing enhanced relaxation and significantly improved restfulness and energy levels after using the machine for only a short time.

A separate study revealed that 56% of newly diagnosed OSA patients already have evidence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, shown in heart sonograms (echocardiograms), while only 20% of the same study’s control patients showed similar damage. After using a CPAP machine, participants also showed significant improvement in the same area. 

Many people who suffer from OSA remain completely unaware of the fact, leaving the initial observation up to a spouse or similar observer who may notice irregular breathing and/or heavy snoring during sleep. If you suspect OSA, or know someone else who exhibits the symptoms, you should speak with your physician about finding an accredited sleep study center to perform a sonogram, which will assess the severity of the possible condition.

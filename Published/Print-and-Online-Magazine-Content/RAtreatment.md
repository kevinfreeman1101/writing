# Setpoint Joins the Fight against Autoimmune Disease

By Kevin Freeman

Anyone who has a passing familiarity with inflammatory autoimmune disease is sure to have witnessed how physically limiting, or even crippling, the condition can be. But thanks to a new research firm called Setpoint, founded in 2007 by neurosurgeon and immunologist Kevin Tracey, modern medical science is on the case. Setpoint’s current technological focus is a neurostimulation device that has already shown remarkable results in the fight against inflammatory and autoimmune disease. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease in which the human body begins to attack itself as though its own vital tissues were a viral threat. Beginning with precisely symmetrical painful sensations that typically originate in the small joints of the fingers, hands, and wrists, RA steadily spreads throughout the body to include the larger joints and tissues, causing heavy inflammation, disfiguration, reduced mobility, or even complete physical disability in many cases. According to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center, as Rheumatoid Arthritis progresses into more advanced stages, it can result in nerve damage that leads to fatality. 

At present, the only thing we can do to fight diseases like RA is shut down the immune system altogether, using revolutionary drugs known commonly as TNF alpha blockers. Treating RA with drugs that inhibit immune response is already proving to be highly effective, yet there are some very dangerous side effects that accompany the treatment which may be worse than the disease itself.

Patients who are undergoing TNF alpha blocker treatments must immediately cease their regimens when they become infected with everyday cold or flu viruses. By stopping their medication, their immune systems are then allowed to mount proper responses against viral attack – but it takes time to flush the drugs from the patients’ systems. Since the drugs often take days to release their hold on immune response capabilities, RA sufferers undergoing such treatments are continually at serious risk from common viruses, and can be killed from viral exposure if the threat isn’t detected quickly enough. 

In response to this setback, Setpoint has developed a highly specialized device that not only disables the Vagus Nerve – and the inflammatory response that it is largely responsible for – but can also be turned off as soon as patients begin to show signs of viral infection. The difference between Setpoint’s device and the current regimen of TNF alpha blockers is that Setpoint’s solution allows immediate response to an immediate threat, which enables the immune system to respond much faster. Although patients must still remain vigilant in their self-monitoring to detect viral infections, they may no longer face the gamble as to whether their immune systems will recover in time. 

While Setpoint’s new treatment has been highly effective in laboratory animals, it hasn’t yet been used in human trials, which means that implementation of the device will likely take some time. However, current sufferers from serious inflammatory maladies such as Rheumatoid Arthritis are now looking at a much brighter outcome for their conditions.

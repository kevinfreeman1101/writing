Idling Laws: How to Comply Without Going Broke

As idling laws become more common on a national level and law enforcement agencies gear up to begin enforcing them, many drivers are wondering what options they still have to meet their needs. From in-cab climate controls and appliances to keeping engines warm in freezing weather, many drivers are faced with tough choices that can have serious financial consequences if they choose to comply with these new laws. Though there are a number of solutions available, the question must be raised as to the impact the laws might have on truck drivers who are already struggling to squeeze profit from their livelihoods. 

After surveying a number of drivers hauling loads through Sacramento, it quickly became clear that most are still running their engines overnight despite recent legislation that outlaws the practice. “I cool myself down with my truck; that’s what I bought it for.” says Walter Derden, an owner operator who is tired of the growing burdens that legislators continue to pile onto the transportation industry. “It’s an unfair burden on truck drivers; most of them aren’t making any money - they’re losing their homes, they’re losing their families, and these dummies are still playing them!”

Though Derden’s sentiments were largely shared by the drivers who were interviewed, it is clear that an idling truck engine will soon carry an added expense in addition to fuel and maintenance costs, and a plan of action will be needed to avoid paying heavy fines in some areas. Thankfully, there are plenty of companies already in place to ease transitional pains, some of which promise to reduce drivers’ operating costs over the long haul. 

According to vendor estimates for the Mid-Atlantic Diesel Collaborative, semi trucks consume 0.8 to 1.6 gallons of precious fuel per hour while idling. Since this expense has already been factored into operating costs, many drivers weren’t aware that this adds up to 1,400 to 2,800 wasted gallons per year from idling alone. At $3 per gallon, this could cost each driver as much as $8,400 annually just for sitting idle! 

In addition to wasted fuel, the EPA estimates that idling adds about “11 million tons of carbon dioxide, 200,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, 5,000 tons of particulate matter, and significant quantities of other harmful air toxics” to the air that we breathe. Regardless of the ongoing global warming debate, these emissions have caused numerous health concerns for those living near truck stops and rest areas – especially concerning young children and the elderly, who have more difficulty combating the toxins that their bodies naturally absorb.  

Here to answer the call for help, Idle Air is a quickly growing driver services company offering a comprehensive in-truck solution. Pull in to an Idle Air slot at a participating truck stop, install your window insert, and activate your session to enjoy the creature comforts of a hotel room inside the cab of your truck. Basic packages – including climate control, power outlets, internet, phone, and television access – cost drivers less than $3 per hour, adding up to considerably less than typical hotel rates, and additional entertainment packages are also available. To sweeten the deal, purchasing a membership package reduces those rates, and transportation companies can also drop prices even further by participating in fleet-wide packages.

Auxiliary power units (APU’s), on the other hand, provide an affordable solution of their own. APU systems can provide climate control and electrical power for up to 20 hours on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Granted, APU’s don’t offer movies on demand or online gaming, but when compared to idling, using an auxiliary power unit can save drivers as much as $8,130 per year at that same $3 per gallon rate, paying for themselves through cost savings and providing increased profits within 6-14 months, depending on the unit selected.

If standard APU’s don’t meet your high standards, Webasto has another solution that may change your mind. The Webasto Bluecool system provides a seasonal solution for cooling off that requires NO additional fuel to operate. Bluecool utilizes a specially engineered cooling tank that freezes liquid into ice blocks while driving so that parked drivers can enjoy chilly forced air for up to 10 hours without running the engine. Webasto’s winter heating units provide bunk heat and engine warming, but they do consume a small amount of fuel, and must be purchased separately from the cooling unit. Webasto systems offer an even greater long-term savings, but it does take longer to pay off the initial purchase, breaking even in about 1.5 years of operation for the whole package. 

Whether you are looking for compliance with burdensome legislation or want to streamline your operations costs, there are a number of solutions on the market that can meet your needs without breaking the bank. Keep in mind, however, that to save money over the long haul, short term profits may see temporary declines.

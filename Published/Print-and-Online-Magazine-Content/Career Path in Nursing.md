Breast Cancer and Oncology – Who to Trust When You’ve been Diagnosed

By Kevin Freeman

In the United States, women are diagnosed with breast cancer more than any other form of cancer except for skin cancer. As a cause of death for women, breast cancer is second only to lung cancer. However, thanks to practices that lead to early detection and technologies that enable more effective treatment, being diagnosed with breast cancer doesn’t have to be the grim sentence that it once was. But when every second counts toward becoming a survivor, figuring out which experts to trust and which to avoid is absolutely crucial.

There is a new trend in cancer treatment that is greatly increasing survival rates for all kinds of cancer patients. Rather than seeking treatment from individual doctors who specialize in particular organs or areas of the body, oncologists (doctors specializing in cancer treatment, especially relating to tumors) are forming teams to create comprehensive plans that cover a far wider range of treatments and specializations, beginning with screening and diagnosis, follow-up care, and palliative care. If you have been diagnosed with breast cancer, seeing an oncologist, or a team of oncologists, should certainly be your first approach.

Unfortunately, there are many other new trends in cancer treatment which might not be as helpful. Many of these disguise their unfounded claims as “alternative medicine”, placing patients on radical diets and “natural therapies” that may do more harm than good – especially if they encourage patients to avoid proven treatments in lieu of more questionable methods. If you, or someone you know, have been diagnosed with any form of cancer, and are researching treatment options, a great place to start can be found at The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) website ([www.cancer.gov](http://www.cancer.gov)), which provides lists of licensed oncologists and doctors who know where to begin. 

Many patients choose to avoid second opinions because they feel like they might be trying to subvert the opinion of their primary doctors, but most doctors do not feel this way at all. Seeking a second opinion can be very helpful in validating a doctor’s concerns, or even finding more valid options to pursue the most effective diagnosis and treatment. Once you’ve found a reputable doctor, experts suggest obtaining a second doctor’s opinion. While medical science is very good at treating and potentially eliminating many diseases, second opinions are very helpful in ensuring a well rounded approach for treatment. 

After finding an effective oncologist or oncology team, the next most important step is finding a reputable treatment facility. The NCI also has a great tool to help patients through this process, which can be found on their website ([https://cissecure.nci.nih.gov/factsheet/FactSheetSearch12.aspx](https://cissecure.nci.nih.gov/factsheet/FactSheetSearch12.aspx)). There are many facilities to choose from, and the NCI can provide very helpful guidance to direct you to the facility that will be most effective and convenient for you. 

Throughout the many difficult stages of breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and recovery, many people have found help through support groups where stories can be shared, treatments discussed, and new hope found. There are many organizations and groups to choose from, ranging from purely scientific groups to faith based groups and social clubs. Because some treatment options work well for some people while having little or no effect on others, keep in mind that any advice received from these groups should be discussed with your oncologist, especially when radical changes from your treatment plan are being considered. The National Breast Cancer Foundation has specialists available for consultation in finding the right groups for you at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237). 

No matter which type of cancer you or someone you know has been diagnosed with, remember that there is always hope for beating the disease – the world is filled with proof of this in the countless survivors who have already been through the trials  of cancer and beaten odds that were heavily stacked against them. While breast cancer is a very serious disease that should be handled proactively as soon as it is detected, maintaining hope for victory is also essential throughout every stage of the battle. Stay connected and ensure that you have full support through the many resources available.

Perhaps most importantly, seek out the experts who will give you the best chances for survival, based on your specific needs and circumstances. And the next time you see an oncologist, be sure to thank him or her for the exceptional work that they do each and every day in the world’s fight against cancer.

Trucking Index Shows Promising Growth Trend: Inspires Confidence That The Industry Will Continue To Expand

Kevin Freeman

If you have an interest in forecasting growth or shrinkage trends in the trucking industry (and what truck driver doesn't have at leas a passing interest?), then you've probably heard of Freight Transportation Research Associates (FTR) – the current leaders in trucking business forecasting. FTR's Trucking Conditions Index (TCI), compiles a wide variety of market factors to indicate healthy markets with positive numbers, troubled markets with negative numbers, and ideal markets for drivers and carriers with positive numbers over 10.0. The TCI increased for the third consecutive month in December, rising to a score of 7.0, up from November's score of 5.2, and marking more than a year of positive territory for the industry. 

A TCI reading of 7.0 shows a moderately healthy market for truckers and carriers, but there is still room for improvement. 

Hours of service (HOS) changes that were anticipated to created severe driver shortages have been postponed to take place in 2013 at the earliest, according to FTR. This postponement was a primary factor in FTR's prediction that 2012's numbers will be even better than the steadily improving numbers we saw in 2011. 

With HOS regulations out of the way, analysts are able to rely on basic supply and demand principles to forecast little or no changes in the current level of trucking capacity while the need for truckers continues to rise. Because drivers will be in shorter supply, trucking rates are likely to rise for carriers, which puts more money into the industry in exchange for the same amount of work. 

Larry Gross, senior consultant for FTR, said in a news release that,“...this growth trend will continue, barring an exterior shock to the economy such as an uncontained European default situation or a disruption emanating form the Mideast.” Gross went on to predict that trucking carriers would be favored for the duration of 2012. 

According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS), truck driving jobs account for a whopping 44 percent of  all wage and salary jobs in the United States – this doesn't include the numerous jobs required to support truck drivers like office and administrative workers, mechanics, salesman, and managers. Available wage and salary jobs in trucking, transportation, and warehousing are forecasted to grow 11 percent between 2008 and 2011, which equals the projected growth for every other industry combined in the same time period. 

As America's GDP grows, the trucking industry must increase at the same pace. After a heart-stopping GDP plummet in recent years, the nation has finally seen a sharp spike that has continued since 2009. Looking at previous GDP spikes over the past 40 years, it is unlikely that the trend will stop any time soon. 

Requirements for drivers to acquire and maintain commercial driver's licenses are also becoming stricter, which translates to fewer drivers in the industry, in addition to less people who will choose truck driving as a career. While this doesn't foster a very friendly environment for drivers, it does give those who are able to stay in the driver's seat a powerful bargaining chip for negotiating pay increases and starting salaries as companies find it more and more difficult to fill driving positions. 

The industry has weathered a nasty storm in recent years, but the good news is that things are finally looking up. Although regulations and world turmoil threaten to stifle the economy at any turn, there is at least sufficient cause to enjoy a bright outlook for the near future.

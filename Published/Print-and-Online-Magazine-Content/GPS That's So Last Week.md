# GPS? That’s So Last Week!

Location-based phone software gives better results without the need for satellites.

Since the advent of global positioning systems (GPS) and their integration on standard cell phones, map sellers around the world have been cursing at their terrible misfortunes while their profit margins are practically swallowed whole by the digital age – or at least they would be if GPS were as reliable as their good old-fashioned maps. Now, the makers and sellers of GPS mobile technology are slated to be cursing alongside them as an emerging software company, GloPos, rolls out its new location-based program. 

Rather than using a satellite signal or wireless LAN connection to find its way, the new patent-pending software from GloPos allows cell phones to triangulate their positions by communicating directly with the nearest cell phone towers to get an accurate triangulation. It does this by sending tiny amounts of information to a specialized server, which uses an advanced algorithm to figure out exactly where the signal came from. The information is sent back within seconds, giving an accurate location on a map that allows you to find your destination.  

In today’s business world, every penny coming in or going out requires constant monitoring and extreme behavioral modification. Which is why a growing number of wireless subscribers have grown tired of paying outrageous monthly fees for wireless internet services that are coupled with even more fees for GPS services, only to end up receiving information that is often unreliable. With Glopos, they don’t have to; the software also gives a more accurate location than GPS presently allows, narrowing down the position to somewhere between 1 and 40 meters, according to their website (glopos.com).

Another reason for drivers to toss their GPS units down, only to pick up their trusty roadmap, is that the satellite-based software doesn’t always have the line-of-sight required to pick up the intended signal. Glopos, on the other hand, boasts accurate location results whether you’re in your house, on the road, or out spelunking in your favorite cave – yes, they even claim to give accurate information even from underground locations, though your phone will still need some reception. 

But wait, there’s more! (Cue the cheesy infomercial music). Normal GPS technology takes a significant amount of battery power to lock on to, and communicate with, satellites in orbit. GloPos gets the job done through normal phone operations, which considerably lowers battery consumption levels in any situation. That means that you won’t have to keep three spare batteries and a charger on hand just in case your phone was acting as a satellite relay for too long.

So where is the downside? As of yet, no one can be certain - GloPos is a newly formed company, having split off from another location-service technology company called 4TS, based in Finland, and has only recently made its presence known to the world. At present, there is no pricing information on their software or scheduled release date. Though the company will have to get their software out through existing cell phone companies – who typically hold the exclusive ability to allow software downloads to their subscribers – GloPos remains optimistic about their future. 

Soon you won’t need premium services to find your pick-up points, load-drops, or hauling centers, plus you won’t receive incorrect directions based on inaccurate information.

So it’s back out with the maps and back in with our regular cell phones and lower bills, because figuring out where we’re going and how we’re getting there just became much easier.

Alcohol and Heart Disease in Men: Interesting Facts to Consider with Caution

Kevin Freeman

In recent decades, numerous studies have been published, having followed tens of thousands of participants over the course of many years, to determine exactly how alcohol consumption is related to incidences of myocardial infarction, or heart attacks, most specifically with regard to men. The results, while controversial enough to rarely gain endorsement due to the significant risks involving alcoholism, show a striking relationship between frequent drinking and heavy reductions in coronary disease.   


Of all the determining factors studied, drinking frequency actually had the strongest association with a reduction in risk. The data clearly showed that excellent benefits were obtained by consuming alcohol at least 3 times per week, with the best benefits achieved by drinking 5-6 days per week – in fact, occasional drinkers actually increased their risk for having coronary disease, with the greatest increase falling among occasional heavy drinkers (either engaging in heavy weekend drinking or random heavy drinking occurrences). One study conducted by the Australian World Health Organization MONICA (Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) actually showed that episodic drinking of 9 or more drinks per drinking day resulted in having double the risk for coronary disease. 

While many people would assume that the healthiest form of alcohol to drink is white or red wine, these have actually been shown to typically be the weakest of the bunch in relation to reducing incidences of heart attack. In fact, researchers found that the most heart healthy drinks in their studies were liquor and beer – both of which offered significantly larger benefits in the same regard. This can only be tempered with the equally provocative data showing that the most popular drink in any given culture also tends to be the one that renders the most benefit, regardless of whether it is beer, liquor, or wine. 

If you had to take a guess, how much alcohol would you assume is healthiest to drink per day? This question was also posed by these studies and, contrary to the 1-2 drinks that most organizations recommend, the amount that seemed to render the most benefit was 50 grams of alcohol per day, or 3-4 standard drinks. Considering this in perspective, however, many other factors come into play, such as a person’s tendency toward alcoholism, binge drinking, and even fatal alcohol related occurrences, either by alcohol poisoning, or through the poor judgment abilities strongly associated with excessive alcohol consumption. 

The relationship between drinking, cholesterol, and blood pressure was mixed, but also yielded some thought provoking results. While cholesterol seemed to vary among participants in every range studied, blood pressure levels were significantly higher among study participants who drank infrequently, or irregularly. Additionally, platelet aggregability – clotting in the blood – was highest among heavy drinkers during periods of withdrawal, and showed significant improvement in lowered clotting levels among moderate drinkers. 

But what about other factors that are known to affect coronary disease? According to the results outlined in these studies, things like exercise, body mass index, hypertension, diet, family history, aspirin use, and diabetes had little effect on any results, suggesting that the effects of alcohol use or abstinence thereof heavily outweigh even these commonly studied factors. This is not to say, of course, that any or all of these factors don’t play their role in the occurrence of coronary disease, but it does lend weight to the serious benefits that may be offered by frequent and responsible alcohol consumption. 

Lastly, since less than 4 percent of study participants consumed more than 50 grams of alcohol per day, the positive or detrimental effects associated with such consumption levels have yet to be fully explored. 

Epidemiological studies such as these are great tools for providing valuable information to advance our knowledge and understanding of the ways that we can live to foster healthy, happy, and long lives. However, extreme caution should always be exercised when considering the results of these types of studies as there are a very great many possible variances or contributing factors that can affect any such study’s results, one or a few of which could even be discovered to have been an even more significant underlying factor in reducing coronary disease than alcohol seems to show here. 

In essence, moderate drinking seems, on the surface, to be a reasonably healthy choice for many, but if it leads to increases in alcohol use, poor judgment, or alcoholism, the fact remains that avoiding it altogether may still be the most responsible choice. Taking this into consideration, always consult your doctor before choosing to explore the possible benefits of alcohol consumption for yourself.

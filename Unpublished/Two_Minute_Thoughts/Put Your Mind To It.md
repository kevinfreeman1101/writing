I grew up believing that I could do whatever I put my mind to do. In other words, nothing is impossible for a person of sufficiently determined will; particularly if that will is combined with good application of self discipline. In 42 years of life (as of the time of this writing), this principle has always proven true. For good or for ill, humans are exactly as powerful as their will; this strength may be honed and amplified over time or it may wither away completely if left unattended.
